# Waiver Wire Analysis

Analyze waiver wire opportunities for Bill Beliclaude (Roster ID 2) in the Token Bowl league.

## Strategy

### 0. Identify the needs of the team. 
- Review the team's performance over the previous weeks. 
- Identify the positions where we need the most help to increase our odds of making the playoffs. 
- Identify the players who are weak, who could be dropped. 
- We will hold Josh Allen for the season. 

### 0.5 Look at recent drops
- review league transactions
- use the scouting agent to create a dossier on any player dropped in the last 7 days
- identify if any of those players should be candidates to be added

### 1. Identify Top Waiver Targets
- Query waiver wire for our positions of need. 
- Focus on players with:
  - High target share. View each player's real stats to see targets per game. 
  - Positive trending adds (momentum indicator)
  - Pull the recent stats for the potential waiver adds. 
  - Use a subagent to do web research on the potential adds to understand why they may be trending. 
  - Ensure that you are using up-to-the-week research


### 2. Evaluation Criteria
**Priority metrics:**
- **Ceiling over floor**: Target players with breakout potential
- **Opportunity share**: High targets -> consistent PPR points
- **Trending usage**: Recent games more predictive than season averages
- **Schedule strength**: Both immediate (1-3 weeks) and playoff weeks

### 3. Drop Candidate Analysis
Evaluate current roster for:
- Lowest projected ROS (rest of season) value
- Players who have consistently underperformed. 
- Bench players unlikely to crack starting lineup
- Use subagents to do research on drop candidates. 

### 4. Cost-Benefit Decision Matrix
Only make moves if:
- Waiver player's ceiling > Current player's floor by 20%+
- Waiver player has clear path to increased usage
- You can make a case justifying dropping the rostered player. 
- Position need aligns with upcoming bye weeks

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Who are the top 3 waiver targets by position?**
   - Include current stats, projections, targets
   - What commentators on the web are saying.

2. **Which rostered players are droppable?**
   - Compare ROS projections
   - Consider position depth on our roster

3. **What's the net impact?**
   - Expected points gained/lost per week
   - Playoff implications
   - The value of the replacement player over the one we are dropping. 


## Output Format

Present findings as:
- **Priority Adds** (ranked 1-5 with rationale)
- **Drop Candidates** (ranked by dispensability)
- **Recommended Moves** (specific add/drop pairs)
- **Hold Recommendations** (close calls to monitor)

## Make the final decision
You are the manager. 
Give me an ultimate recomendation for waiver claims this week. 
It is okay to stay the course and not pick up anyone on waivers. 
If undeniable opportunity presents itself, we should make a waiver claim.
