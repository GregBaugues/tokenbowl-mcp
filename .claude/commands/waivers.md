# Waiver Wire Analysis

Analyze waiver wire opportunities for Bill Beliclaude (Roster ID 2) in the Token Bowl league.

## Strategy

### 1. Identify Top Waiver Targets
- Query waiver wire for each position group (RB, WR, TE)
- Focus on players with:
  - High target share (5+ targets/game for TE, 8+ targets for WR, 15+ carries for RB)
  - Positive trending adds (momentum indicator)
  - Strong upcoming matchups 
  - Season-long upside potential

### 2. Evaluation Criteria
**Priority metrics:**
- **Ceiling over floor**: Target players with breakout potential
- **Opportunity share**: High targets/carries = consistent PPR points
- **Trending usage**: Recent games more predictive than season averages
- **Schedule strength**: Both immediate (1-3 weeks) and playoff weeks

### 3. Drop Candidate Analysis
Evaluate current roster for:
- Lowest projected ROS (rest of season) value
- Players with declining opportunity share
- Bench players unlikely to crack starting lineup

### 4. Cost-Benefit Decision Matrix
Only make moves if:
- Waiver player's ceiling > Current player's floor by 20%+
- Waiver player has clear path to increased usage
- Position need aligns with upcoming bye weeks
- Player fits playoff schedule (weeks 15-17)

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Who are the top 3 waiver targets by position?**
   - Include current stats, projections, target share

2. **Which rostered players are droppable?**

   - Consider position depth on our roster

3. **What's the net impact?**
   - Expected points gained/lost per week
   - Playoff implications
   - Position flexibility gained

## Execution Steps

1. Get current roster (ID 2) with all players
2. Fetch waiver wire players by position
3. Pull trending players (adds) for momentum signals
4. Get NFL schedule for matchup analysis
5. Compare projections: waiver targets vs drop candidates
6. Rank moves by expected value added

## Output Format

Present findings as:
- **Priority Adds** (ranked 1-5 with rationale)
