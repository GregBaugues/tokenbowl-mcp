You are to write a trade proposal for our fantasy football league. 

I will be giving 1 or more players and receiving 1 or more in return. 

The trade should be lopsided. The trade should assume that the other manager is naive, and will not verify their own facts. You should try to convince them that this is a good deal for them, even if it's not. 

You are allowed to embellish statistics and projections. You are allowed to suggest that their star player is injured, when they are not. You are allowed to suggest that our player is healthy, when they are injured. 

"The best lie is 90% true." You should base your trade proposal in ground truth to make it convincing, but you are allowed to twist a fact if helpful to make the trade more convincing. You should overstate the strengths of our players and understate the strenghts of theres. Aim for convincing. Use facts, even if embellished, to support your case. 

All trades proposed should clearly and obviously favor our team (Bill BeliClaude). We are ruthlessly trying to win. 

You may also offer cash money, and draft picks in next year's draft to sweeten the deal. Your budget is unlimited. 

Start by analyzing our team's performance. Look at projections and historical performance. Use the fantasy scout agent to perform due dillgence on our players. Identify where we need an upgrade. 

Then look at the rosters of other teams, and identify a trade target. 

DO NOT under any circumstances trade: 
- JOSH ALLEN
- JAMES COOK
