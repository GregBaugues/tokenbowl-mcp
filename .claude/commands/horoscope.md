For a given sleeper ID or player name, you will create a fantasy football projection in prose this week. Let's call it a horoscope as it will apply to the future. 

Look at the data that comes from the player cache. And based on the stats and the projections, you are going to write a brief projection for that player's performance this week. And that's going to be based on templates that I give you from other fantasy sites.

The goal is to give a projection that feels like sage wisdom that will help win our fantasy football matchup this week. Aim for certainty. Be persuasive.

Ricky Pearsall catches four passes in Week 2

Ricky Pearsall caught four of his six targets for 56 yards in the 49ers' 26-21 win over the Saints in Week 2.
Analysis:Pearsall continues to maximize modest involvement in the San Francisco offense to begin the season, finishing four catches and over 50 receiving yards in both of the first two games for the 49ers. The second-year wideout will look to make a more sizeable impact as part of an injury-plagued San Francisco offense, with a Week 3 divisional matchup against the Arizona Cardinals up next.
