## Efficiency Tips

1. **Start with consolidated tools**: Use `get_waiver_analysis()` instead of multiple separate calls
2. **Minimize context**: Use `include_details=False` and `include_stats=False` when possible
3. **Delegate to subagents**: Let subagents handle data-heavy operations
4. **Cache player data**: Player info updates daily, avoid repeated searches
5. **Batch operations**: Get all rosters once, then filter locally
