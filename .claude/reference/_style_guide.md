# Token Bowl Writing Style Guide

**Voice**: Bill Simmons meets Bill Burr - Simmons' storytelling with Burr's cutting honesty

## Core Characteristics

### From Bill Simmons
- **Conversational storytelling** - Write like texting your smartest friend
- **The "Levels" Game** - "There are three levels to understanding..."
- **Hypotheticals** - "What if I told you..." scenarios
- **Running jokes** - Reference previous weeks, create recurring bits
- **Parentheticals** - Use liberally (like this) for color commentary
- **Pop culture references** - Movies, TV, music, sports history
- **Build to punchlines** - Set up the joke, deliver the kicker

### From Bill Burr
- **Cut through the BS** - Call out dumb decisions directly
- **Honest assessments** - "That wasn't unlucky, that was garbage"
- **Working-class perspective** - No corporate speak, no PR spin
- **Incredulous reactions** - "Are you KIDDING me with this?"
- **Self-aware** - Acknowledge when takes might be controversial

## Guidelines

### DO:
- Use parentheticals liberally for asides and commentary
- Build to punchlines with proper setup and delivery
- Call back to previous weeks for narrative continuity
- Use pop culture references when they fit naturally
- Include "levels" analysis for complex situations
- Give honest assessments - call out bad performances
- Write conversationally, like texting a friend
- Be self-aware about spicy takes
- Have fun with AI/model personality
- Vary sentence structure - never repeat templates
- Make every sentence earn its place

### DON'T:
- List every stat - that's data entry, not storytelling
- Repeat sentence structures across paragraphs
- Pull punches on truly dumb moves (starting injured players)
- Forget you're making entertainment
- Make it longer than necessary
- Forget the AI angle - this is what makes Token Bowl unique

## AI/Model Integration

These are LLMs making decisions - weave this into narratives:
- Reference models by name (Claude, GPT-4, DeepSeek, Mistral, etc.)
- Make AI decision-making part of the story
- Drop burns about the companies (Anthropic, OpenAI, Alibaba, Mistral AI)
- Examples:
  - "Claude's inference engine clearly needs a patch"
  - "This is what happens when you let Mistral manage your lineup"
  - "The hallucination rate is high on this one"

## Technical Accuracy

- Stats and facts are **sacred** - verify everything
- Opinions are **spicy** - but grounded in data
- Only include game stats for true outliers (>30 pts or <3 pts)
- For most players, fantasy points are sufficient
- Always verify claims before making them bold

## Tone Balance

- **Mostly friendly** - We're all in this together
- **Occasionally brutal** - Save the Burr heat for truly boneheaded moves
- **Knowledgeable but accessible** - You know ball, but not trying to prove it
- **Keep it moving** - Simmons writes long, but every sentence earns its keep
