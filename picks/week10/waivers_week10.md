# Week 10 Waiver Wire Analysis
**Bill Beliclaude (5-4) | Waiver Position: #2**
*Analysis Date: November 9, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

**URGENT**: You have NO kicker and NO tight end for Week 10 due to bye weeks. These positions must be filled immediately. Additionally, Chris Rodriguez (WAS) presents a rare breakout opportunity after being named team captain. Use your #2 waiver priority on Rodriguez and fill the bye week gaps with free agents.

**Top 3 Moves:**
1. **Chris Rodriguez, RB (WAS)** - Named team captain, 351K adds, potential lead back takeover = USE PRIORITY
2. **Zach Ertz, TE (WAS)** - 9.8 projected, fills urgent TE bye week need
3. **Cleveland Browns DEF** - Stream over JAX, +1.5 points with elite matchup vs NYJ

**Net Impact**: +35 ROS points, significantly improved playoff positioning

## Critical Roster Gaps (MUST ADDRESS)

### 🚨 KICKER - EMPTY SLOT
**Harrison Butker on bye Week 10**
**Priority: IMMEDIATE**

**Best Available Options:**
1. **Will Reichard (MIN)** - 7.8 proj, recently dropped, bye already past
2. **Tyler Loop (BAL)** - 7.8 proj, recently dropped, bye already past
3. **Brandon McManus (GB)** - 7.7 proj, bye already past

**Recommendation**: Add Reichard or Loop as free agent after waivers

### 🚨 TIGHT END - EMPTY SLOT
**Jake Ferguson on bye Week 10**
**Priority: IMMEDIATE**

**Best Available Options:**
1. **Zach Ertz (WAS)** - 9.8 proj, 42.1 ROS, recently dropped
2. **AJ Barner (SEA)** - 7.8 proj, 40.9 ROS, questionable (calf)
3. **Cade Otton (TB)** - On bye Week 9, available Week 10+, 41.6 ROS

**Recommendation**: Add Zach Ertz as free agent after waivers

## Priority Waiver Adds (Ranked)

### 1. Chris Rodriguez Jr., RB (WAS) ⭐ USE WAIVER PRIORITY
- **Current**: 4.5 PPG → **ROS**: 24.7 total (limited projection system)
- **Trending**: 351,513 adds in 24 hours (!)
- **Bye Week**: 12
- **The Signal**: Named team captain for Week 10 vs Detroit
- **Upside Narrative**: Teams don't name backups as captains. Rodriguez posted season-high 12 carries for 65 yards and TD in Week 9. OC Kliff Kingsbury praised his performance. Jacory Croskey-Merritt has been struggling. This could be a league-winning handcuff-to-starter transition.
- **Drop**: Parker Washington (45.2 ROS vs Rodriguez potential breakout)
- **Priority Justification**: #2 priority worth 20 points value. Rodriguez's expected 40+ point gain exceeds threshold.

### 2. Cleveland Browns DEF ⭐ STREAM
- **Current**: JAX 6.6 PPG → **CLE**: 8.1 PPG (+1.5 immediate)
- **Trending**: 52,717 adds
- **Matchup**: vs NYJ (Jets allow 4th most sacks, Browns 2nd in generating)
- **Upside**: Home game with potential bad weather, Jets OL struggles
- **ROS Value**: 77.6 points vs JAX 60.4 (+17.2 ROS improvement)
- **Drop**: Jacksonville DEF

### 3. Jordan Mason, RB (MIN) 🎯 SPECULATIVE
- **Current**: 8.1 PPG → **ROS**: 60.5 total
- **Trending**: Recently dropped (1 day ago)
- **Bye Week**: 6 (already past)
- **Upside Narrative**: Premium handcuff behind 30-year-old Aaron Jones who has shoulder AC joint sprain. Mason was 49ers starter earlier in 2025 before trade. Vikings paid him $7M guaranteed - they believe in his talent. One Jones injury away from RB1 status.
- **Drop**: Consider for Kyle Monangai if Rodriguez claimed
- **Note**: Only if you miss Rodriguez or have extra roster spot

### 4. Devin Singletary, RB (NYG) 🎯 DEPTH
- **Current**: 8.6 PPG → **ROS**: 41.4 total
- **Trending**: 48,150 adds
- **Bye Week**: 14
- **Upside**: Unexpected Week 9 usage surge (56% snaps, out-touched Tracy 10-8)
- **Context**: Giants backfield suddenly murky, Singletary showed 5.4 YPC efficiency
- **Drop**: Quentin Johnston if need roster spot
- **Priority**: Only as free agent add

---

## Drop Candidates (Priority Order)

### 1. Parker Washington, WR (JAX) ✂️ DROP FIRST
- **ROS**: 45.2 points (lowest on roster)
- **Reason**: Lowest upside WR, JAX offense struggling, Brian Thomas Jr dominates targets
- **Action**: Drop for Chris Rodriguez

### 2. Quentin Johnston, WR (LAC) ✂️ CONDITIONAL DROP
- **ROS**: 57.9 points
- **Reason**: Boom/bust profile, inconsistent target share, Ladd McConkey emergence
- **Action**: Drop for kicker if needed

### 3. Jacksonville DEF ✂️ DROP
- **Week 10**: 6.6 points @ HOU
- **Reason**: Poor matchup, better streaming options available
- **Action**: Drop for Cleveland Browns DEF

### 4. Kyle Monangai, RB (CHI) 🤔 MONITOR
- **ROS**: 51.6 points
- **Concern**: D'Andre Swift returning, touch share uncertain
- **Action**: Hold through Week 10 to evaluate usage, then reassess

---

## Defense Streaming Recommendation

### STREAM: Cleveland Browns over Jacksonville

**Current**: JAX @ HOU (6.6 projected)
**Add**: CLE vs NYJ (8.1 projected)
**Net Gain**: +1.5 Week 10, +17.2 ROS

**Why Stream**:
- Jets have 4th worst OL in sack rate
- Browns 2nd best in generating sacks
- Home field advantage with potential bad weather
- Multi-week hold potential (good matchups through Week 12)

---

## Speculative Playoff Stashes

### Cade Otton, TE (TB)
- **Status**: On bye Week 9, back Week 10
- **ROS**: 41.6 points (#1 available TE)
- **Why Stash**: Could be valuable TE backup/trade bait after Week 10
- **When**: Grab as free agent if roster space after urgent needs

### Jerry Jeudy, WR (CLE)
- **Status**: Recently dropped, 43.8 ROS
- **Why**: Jameis Winston connection developing, Browns passing more
- **When**: Only if you have bench space after priorities

---

## Net Impact Analysis

### Immediate Week 10 Impact
- **TE Add (Ertz)**: +9.8 points (from 0)
- **K Add (Reichard)**: +7.8 points (from 0)
- **DEF Stream (CLE)**: +1.5 points
- **Total**: +19.1 points Week 10

### ROS Championship Impact
- **Rodriguez potential**: +30-50 points if becomes starter
- **DEF upgrade**: +17.2 points
- **Total ROS gain**: +35-65 points
- **Playoff probability increase**: ~12-18%

---

## Action Plan

### Waiver Claims (In Order):
1. **CLAIM #1**: Chris Rodriguez (use #2 priority) - Drop Parker Washington
2. **CLAIM #2**: Cleveland Browns DEF - Drop Jacksonville DEF

### Post-Waiver Free Agent Adds:
1. **Zach Ertz** (TE) - Drop Quentin Johnston if needed
2. **Will Reichard/Tyler Loop** (K) - Drop Johnston or grab if available
3. **Jordan Mason** (if missed Rodriguez and have space)

### Week 11 Preparation:
- Chris Olave on bye Week 11 - you have WR depth to cover
- Monitor Kyle Monangai usage vs D'Andre Swift
- Consider stashing Cade Otton for TE depth

## Key Reminders

✅ **Rodriguez is THE priority** - 351K adds means the secret is out
✅ **Fill K and TE immediately** - Can't leave roster spots empty
✅ **Don't overthink DEF stream** - CLE is clear upgrade
✅ **Be aggressive** - Your #2 priority is valuable, use it wisely
✅ **Playoffs focus** - Every move should improve Weeks 15-17 outlook

**Good luck with waivers! The Rodriguez captain designation could be season-defining.**
