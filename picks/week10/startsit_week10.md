### Critical Decisions

#### TE REPLACEMENT (URGENT)
**Jake Ferguson - ON BYE WEEK 10**

Top Waiver Options:
1. **Cade Otton** (TB) vs NE - Best floor/ceiling combo vs 31st-ranked TE defense
2. **AJ Barner** (CAR) vs NO - Upside if healthy (questionable-calf)
3. **Taysom Hill** (NO) @ CAR - Gadget floor but low ceiling

**Recommendation**: Add Cade Otton immediately

#### FLEX POSITIONS

**Current Setup Issues:**
- Kyle Monangai (9.6) - D'Andre Swift returning, committee concerns
- Woody Marks (10.5) - Solid floor but limited ceiling

**Recommended Changes:**

**FLEX 1**: Keep **Woody Marks** (10.5)
- Volume-based floor vs JAX allowing 140+ rush YPG
- Texans should control game
- 15+ touch expectation

**FLEX 2**: Start **Rachaad White** (13.9) over Monangai
- Dream matchup vs NE 30th-ranked run D
- Clear volume with Bucky Irving still limited
- Superior floor/ceiling to committee-bound Monangai

**Alternative**: **DeVonta Smith** (14.0)
- Consider over Marvin Harrison Jr at WR2
- Monday night passing volume
- Packers struggle with WR2s

### Defense Streaming

**Current**: JAX @ HOU - 6.6 pts
- Tough road divisional matchup
- Allowed 25+ in 4 straight road games
- Trap play alert

**Top Streaming Options:**

1. **Baltimore Ravens** @ MIN - 7.6 pts (+1.0)
   - J.J. McCarthy prone to sacks
   - 15 fantasy points last week
   - Strong ROS schedule

2. **Tampa Bay** vs NE - 7.4 pts (+0.8)
   - Off bye week advantage
   - Home game vs rookie QB
   - Todd Bowles' blitz packages

3. **Detroit** @ WAS - 7.3 pts (+0.7)
   - **Marcus Mariota starting** (backup QB)
   - 4-game losing streak for WAS
   - 14 sacks in last 4 games

**Recommendation**: Stream Baltimore Ravens DEF

## Optimized Lineup

### Bench

- Marvin Harrison Jr (or DeVonta if not starting)
- Kyle Monangai (Swift committee)
- Quentin Johnston (tough matchup)
- Parker Washington (avoid)
- Jacory Croskey-Merritt (desperation only)
- JAX DEF (drop for Baltimore)

## Action Items

### Immediate (Before Sunday 1pm ET):

1. ✅ **Add TE**: Claim Cade Otton (or AJ Barner/Taysom Hill)
2. ✅ **Stream DEF**: Add Baltimore Ravens, drop JAX
3. ✅ **Set Lineup**: Bench Monangai for Rachaad White
4. ⚠️ **Monitor**: Swift/Monangai situation through warmups

### Game-Time Decisions:

- **WR2**: DeVonta Smith vs Marvin Harrison Jr
  - Smith: Safer floor (14.0), Monday night volume
  - MHJ: Higher ceiling potential, divisional game
  - **Lean**: DeVonta for floor, MHJ for ceiling

### Sunday Morning News Check:
- Swift's status/workload expectations
- McLaurin status (affects DET DEF value)
- Aaron Jones status (affects BAL DEF value)

## Summary

The optimized lineup addresses all critical issues:
- ✅ Ferguson's bye week covered (Otton)
- ✅ Monangai's committee risk mitigated (White)
- ✅ Defense upgraded for better matchup (Ravens)
- ✅ Maximized projected points (135.8)

The key is acting quickly on waivers for the TE and DEF positions while making the smart pivot from Monangai to White given the Swift news. This lineup balances floor and ceiling while avoiding the major pitfalls of bye weeks and committee situations.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - This lineup maximizes your scoring potential while minimizing risk in Week 10.
