# Week 4 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude

## Current Situation
- **Record**: 2-1
- **Waiver Priority**: 4th (improved from 8th!)
- **Critical Need**: RB depth (only 1 backup RB)
- **Date**: September 26, 2025

## Roster Needs Assessment

### Position Breakdown
- **RB (CRITICAL)**: 3 total (Cook, Gibbs, Allgeier) - Need 1-2 more for depth
- **WR (Sufficient)**: 7 total - Well covered with MHJ, DJ Moore, Shakir on bench
- **QB (Set)**: Josh Allen - No backup needed (bye week 12)
- **TE (Adequate)**: 2 total (Ferguson, Strange)
- **K/DEF**: No backups needed

## Priority Waiver Targets

### 1. **TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE) - TOP PRIORITY**
- **Status**: Dropped TODAY by roster 10
- **Projections**: 10.5 pts/week, 97.7 ROS
- **Context**: Seeing increased usage and targets in New England offense
- **Rationale**: Best available RB, fills critical need, opponent's mistake
- **Priority Analysis**: Worth using waiver claim (37.4 net points value)

### 2. **Keon Coleman (WR, BUF)**
- **Status**: Dropped 6 days ago
- **Projections**: 10.7 pts/week, 103.7 ROS
- **Context**: Seeing increased usage, Josh Allen connection
- **Rationale**: Upgrade over bench WRs, stack with Allen, high ceiling

### 3. **Chris Rodriguez (RB, WAS)**
- **Status**: Trending (256k adds!)
- **Projections**: 6.8 pts/week, 62.5 ROS
- **Context**: Increased usage with Croskey-Merritt injured (questionable)
- **Rationale**: RB depth with immediate opportunity

### 4. **Kareem Hunt (RB, KC)**
- **Status**: Trending (59k adds)
- **Projections**: 8.9 pts/week, 78.0 ROS
- **Context**: Increased usage in KC offense as lead back
- **Rationale**: Proven veteran with TD upside

### 5. **Tyquan Thornton (WR, KC)**
- **Status**: Most trending add (263k!)
- **Projections**: 8.6 pts/week, 58.8 ROS
- **Context**: Seeing increased targets in KC
- **Rationale**: Lower priority given WR depth

## Drop Candidates

### Primary Drop: **Brenton Strange (TE)**
- **Projections**: 8.4 pts/week
- **Rationale**: Jake Ferguson is locked in starter, TE streaming viable if needed
- **Risk**: Low - can stream TE if Ferguson injured

### Hold All Others
- **Tyler Allgeier**: Must hold as only backup RB
- **WR Bench**: All project 11+ weekly points
- **Josh Allen/James Cook**: Season-long holds

## Final Recommendation

### **MAKE THE CLAIM**

**Waiver Claim #1 (USE PRIORITY - 4th)**
- **ADD**: TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE)
- **DROP**: Brenton Strange (TE)
- **Justification**:
  - Addresses critical RB depth need
  - 97.7 ROS projection vs 62.0 for Strange
  - Net gain of 35.7 ROS points
  - Priority value analysis confirms worth using (37.4 net value)
  - Dropped TODAY - likely an overreaction

### Backup Plans (if Henderson claimed)
**Waiver Claim #2:**
- **ADD**: Chris Rodriguez (RB, WAS)
- **DROP**: Brenton Strange (TE)
- Immediate opportunity with starter injured

**Waiver Claim #3:**
- **ADD**: Kareem Hunt (RB, KC)
- **DROP**: Brenton Strange (TE)
- Lead back role in high-powered offense

## Key Insights
1. **Recently Dropped Gems**: Henderson was mistakenly dropped TODAY - classic overreaction. Our opponents make mistakes!
2. **Position Scarcity**: RB depth critical with only Allgeier backing up Cook/Gibbs
3. **Waiver Priority**: At 4th (improved from 8th!), worth using for 4+ point weekly upgrade at position of need
4. **WR Depth**: Can pass on trending WRs given our 7 rostered receivers
5. **Trending Context**: Rodriguez and Hunt both seeing increased usage due to injuries/opportunity

## Decision: CLAIM HENDERSON

This move addresses our biggest roster weakness and capitalizes on an opponent's mistake. The 37.4 point net value easily justifies using our waiver priority.

### Why Now?
- Henderson projects as RB24 rest of season (97.7 pts)
- Clear path to touches in New England
- RB scarcity on waivers makes this a rare opportunity
- Our improved waiver position (4th) gives us good chance to land him

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Dropping Strange doesn't hurt with Ferguson healthy
- **High Reward**: Henderson could be flex-worthy or bye week savior
- **Alternative**: If we don't get RB depth now, we're vulnerable to injury/bye weeks
