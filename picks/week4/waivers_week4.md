# Week 4 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude

**Date:** September 24, 2025
**Record:** 2-1
**Waiver Priority:** 9

## Team Needs Assessment

### Critical Roster Gaps
- **RB Depth:** CRITICAL - Zero bench RBs (only Gibbs/Cook rostered)
- **QB Backup:** HIGH - No backup for Josh Allen (bye Week 12)
- **WR Depth:** OVERSTOCKED - 8 total WRs (need to consolidate)

### Recent Performance
- Week 1: W 140.96
- Week 2: L 120.32
- Week 3: W 157.32
- **Trend:** Solid scoring but vulnerable to injuries with no RB depth

## Priority Waiver Targets

### 1. **Kareem Hunt (RB, KC)** - CLAIM IMMEDIATELY
- **132,816 adds trending**
- **Stats:** 11.4 PPR Week 3 with TD, now lead back with Pacheco on IR
- **Opportunity:** 4-6 week starter window in elite KC offense
- **Week 4:** vs BAL (tough matchup but goal-line role in high-scoring offense)
- **Verdict:** Instant RB3/flex with RB2 upside - fills immediate need

### 2. **Trey Benson (RB, ARI)** - STRONG CLAIM
- **288,834 adds trending**
- **Stats:** Consistent 8+ PPR points all 3 weeks (8.5, 8.4, 8.1)
- **Role:** Clear RB2 getting 7 carries + 3-4 targets per game
- **Upside:** James Conner recently dropped, making Benson the lead back
- **Week 4:** vs SEA Thursday (must claim Wednesday!)
- **Verdict:** Perfect bench RB with RB1 upside

### 3. **Blake Corum (RB, LAR)** - CONSIDER
- **118,088 adds trending**
- **Stats:** 10.4 PPR Week 2 with TD, averaging 6.1 PPG
- **Role:** Pure handcuff to Kyren Williams
- **Verdict:** Only if roster space allows after Hunt/Benson

## Drop Candidates (Ranked)

### 1. **Troy Franklin (WR, DEN)** - PRIMARY DROP
- Boom/bust profile (24 pts Week 2, but 8.4 and 2.8 other weeks)
- 5th/6th WR option with 4 stronger bench WRs ahead
- Projected only 7.7 PPG

### 2. **Quentin Johnston (WR, LAC)** - SECONDARY DROP
- Projected 11.5 PPG but hasn't lived up to potential
- Behind Marvin Harrison Jr., Khalil Shakir in pecking order
- Chargers passing game inconsistent

### Hold Recommendations
- **Marvin Harrison Jr.:** Still has name value and upside despite slow start
- **Brenton Strange:** Solid TE2 with 5+ targets per game (8.9 PPG)
- **Matt Prater:** Averaging 11 PPG, elite offense
- **Khalil Shakir:** WR2 in Bills offense with Allen

## Recent Drops to Monitor
- **Brock Purdy (QB, SF):** Injured (toe), only played Week 1
- **James Conner (RB, ARI):** Dropped for Benson - if available, instant claim
- **Calvin Ridley (WR, TEN):** We dropped him, don't reconsider

## Final Recommendation

### EXECUTE THESE CLAIMS (in order):

**Priority 1: Add Kareem Hunt, Drop Troy Franklin**
- Addresses critical RB need with immediate starter value
- Hunt slots into flex consideration immediately

**Priority 2: Add Trey Benson, Drop Quentin Johnston**
- Insurance + potential RB1 with Conner gone
- Better value than holding 8th WR

### RESULT:
- Fixes critical RB depth (0 → 2 bench RBs)
- Maintains WR depth at reasonable level (8 → 6)
- Positions team for playoff run with proper roster construction

## Alternative Strategy
If both claims fail, pivot to:
- Chris Rodriguez (WAS) - 484k adds, getting goal-line work
- Blake Corum (LAR) for handcuff value
- Consider streaming QB for Allen's bye week later

## Bottom Line
**This is the week to be aggressive.** With zero RB depth, we're one injury away from disaster. Both Hunt and Benson offer immediate help with different timelines - Hunt for the next month, Benson potentially for the season with Conner dropped. The cost (dropping WR depth) is minimal given our oversupply.

**Net Impact:** +8-12 expected PPG in flex spot, eliminates catastrophic injury risk
