# Week 4 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Current Record**: 2-1
**Waiver Priority**: 5 of 10

## Roster Needs Assessment

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- **RB DEPTH CRISIS**: Only 1 bench RB (Blake Corum - 4.1 proj points)
  - This is our highest priority - an injury to Cook or Gibbs would devastate our lineup
  - Corum averaging just 6.1 PPG through 3 weeks (10.4 in Week 2, but only 2.6 and 5.3 in others)
  - Must secure RB depth immediately

### Position Analysis
- **QB**: Set with Josh Allen (keeper)
- **RB**: James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs (starters) + Blake Corum (weak bench)
- **WR**: Overstocked with 7 total (DJ Moore, DeVonta Smith, Chris Olave, Ricky Pearsall starting + Marvin Harrison, Khalil Shakir, Quentin Johnston bench)
- **TE**: Adequate with Jake Ferguson + Brenton Strange
- **K/DEF**: Set with Matt Prater and GB

## Top Waiver Targets

### Priority Adds (Ranked 1-5)

#### 1. **Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL)** - PRIORITY CLAIM
- **Recently dropped** (5 days ago)
- **Season Performance**:
  - Week 2: 16 carries, 76 yards, 1 TD (15.0 PPR points)
  - Averaging 9 carries/game with RB2 role
- **Projection**: 6.3 PPG (vs Corum's 4.1)
- **Rationale**: Proven NFL back, clear handcuff to Bijan Robinson, immediate upgrade
- **Waiver Cost Analysis**: Worth using #5 priority (49 point expected value vs 15 point priority cost)

#### 2. **Chris Rodriguez (RB, WAS)**
- **MASSIVE TRENDING**: 257,058 adds (2nd most trending player league-wide)
- **Week 3 Breakout**: 11 carries for 39 yards - emerging as RB2
- **Projection**: 6.7 PPG
- **Rationale**: Rising opportunity in Washington backfield, getting goal-line work
- **Note**: If Allgeier is taken, pivot here immediately

#### 3. **Brian Robinson (RB, SF)**
- **Recently dropped** (7 days ago)
- **Season Stats**: 17 carries, 2 receptions through 3 games
- **Projection**: 4.9 PPG
- **Rationale**: RB2 in SF system, better than Corum for depth

#### 4. **Antonio Gibson (RB, NE)**
- **Role**: RB3 in New England, pass-catching specialist
- **Projection**: 5.2 PPG
- **Rationale**: PPR upside with receiving work, better floor than Corum

#### 5. **Braelon Allen (RB, NYJ)**
- **Rising rookie**: Clear RB2 behind Breece Hall
- **Projection**: 4.8 PPG
- **Rationale**: Elite handcuff value if Hall gets hurt

### Notable WR Options (Not Priority Given Our Depth)
- **Calvin Ridley (WR, TEN)** - dropped 1 day ago, but we're overstocked at WR
- **Jordan Addison (WR, MIN)** - dropped 7 days ago
- **Keon Coleman (WR, BUF)** - dropped 5 days ago, could stack with Josh Allen

## Drop Candidates (Ranked by Dispensability)

### 1. **Blake Corum (RB, LAR)** - DROP IF CLAIMING RB
- Lowest RB projections on roster (4.1 PPG)
- Limited opportunity behind Kyren Williams
- Clear upgrades available on waivers

### 2. **Quentin Johnston (WR, LAC)** - CONSIDER DROPPING
- Boom/bust WR with 11.4 projection but high variance
- We have 6 other WRs with similar or better upside
- Could drop for second RB claim if needed

### 3. **Brenton Strange (TE, JAX)** - HOLD
- Keep for bye week coverage
- 8.5 PPG projection is solid TE2

## Waiver Priority Cost-Benefit Analysis

Using our waiver evaluation tool:
- **Current Position**: 5 of 10 (middle tier)
- **Expected Points Gain**: 3.5 PPG (Allgeier over Corum)
- **Total Season Value**: 49 points
- **Priority Value**: 15 points
- **Net Value**: +34 points
- **Recommendation**: CLAIM - Clear positive expected value

## Final Recommendation

### **MAKE THE CLAIM**

**Primary Move:**
- **ADD: Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL)**
- **DROP: Blake Corum (RB, LAR)**
- **USE WAIVER PRIORITY #5**

**Rationale:**
1. Critical RB depth need (only 1 weak bench RB)
2. Allgeier offers 2.2+ PPG upgrade over Corum
3. Worth 49 points over season vs 15 point priority value
4. Proven NFL back with TD upside (scored in Week 2)
5. Insurance for Cook/Gibbs injuries

**Backup Claims (if Allgeier taken):**
1. Chris Rodriguez for Corum (trending massively)
2. Brian Robinson for Corum
3. Antonio Gibson for Corum

### Secondary Considerations
- If we miss on Allgeier but get Rodriguez, consider dropping Quentin Johnston for another RB
- Monitor Aaron Jones injury status (IR now, expected Week 8 return)
- James Conner on IR with foot injury - monitor return timeline

## Week 4 Matchup Notes
- Our RBs face: BUF (Cook) and DET (Gibbs) - both tough matchups
- Having reliable RB depth is crucial this week

## Summary
This is a **GO** week for waivers. Our RB depth is critically thin with only Blake Corum backing up our starters. Tyler Allgeier represents both an immediate upgrade (2.2+ PPG) and essential insurance. Using our middle-tier waiver priority (5 of 10) for a projected 49-point season gain is mathematically sound and addresses our biggest roster vulnerability. The trending data on Chris Rodriguez also makes him an excellent pivot if Allgeier is claimed.
