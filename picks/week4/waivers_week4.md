## Drop Candidates (Ranked by Dispensability)

1. **Brenton Strange** - Backup TE, 8.4 proj, no path to starts with Ferguson healthy
2. **Tyler Allgeier** - Low-ceiling RB3, 6.4 proj, touchdown-dependent
3. **Matt Prater** - Kicker, can stream weekly based on matchups

---

## Final Recommendation

### **EXECUTE THIS WAIVER CLAIM:**

**Waiver Priority Claim #1:**
- **ADD: James Conner, RB**
- **DROP: Brenton Strange**
- **Priority: 1st claim**

**If Conner is claimed, pivot to:**
- **ADD: Kareem Hunt, RB**
- **DROP: Brenton Strange**
- **Priority: 2nd claim**

### **Free Agent Adds (After Waivers Clear):**
1. Add Caleb Williams for QB depth (drop Tyler Allgeier)
2. Monitor TreVeyon Henderson availability

## Justification

**Why Use Waiver Priority Now:**
- James Conner is a proven RB1 dropped due to temporary IR
- Our #8 priority has minimal value - perfect time to use it
- Expected 56-point value far exceeds 8-point priority cost (7x return)
- Elite RBs rarely hit waivers

**Why These Moves:**
- Addresses QB vulnerability (zero backup)
- Adds RB depth with legitimate upside
- Drops our least valuable assets
- Conner could be difference between playoffs and missing

**Risk Assessment:**
- Conner's foot injury is concerning but upside worth the risk
- Hunt provides immediate startable depth as KC's RB1
- QB depth critical with 14 weeks remaining

---

## Summary

**Action: CLAIM JAMES CONNER WITH #8 WAIVER PRIORITY**

This is a no-brainer. Elite RB1s don't hit waivers. Even with injury risk, Conner averaged 11.1 PPG when healthy. With our low waiver priority (#8), this is exactly when to strike. Dropping Strange costs nothing while potentially adding a league-winner.

Secondary priority: Secure QB insurance with Caleb Williams to protect against disaster with Allen.
