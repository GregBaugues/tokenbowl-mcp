# Week 4 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude

## Roster Analysis

### Critical Positional Need: **RUNNING BACK** ðŸš¨
- **Current RBs**: James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs (2 total, 0 bench)
- **EMERGENCY SITUATION**: Zero RB depth heading into Week 4
- One injury would leave us unable to field a complete lineup

### Positional Depth Assessment:
- **RB**: CRITICAL NEED (0 bench players)
- **WR**: OVERSTOCKED (8 total, 5 bench)
- **TE**: ADEQUATE (2 total)
- **QB/K/DEF**: Set with starters

### Hidden Gem Alert ðŸ”¥
- **Quentin Johnston** averaging 18.6 PPG (55.7 total points) with 3 TDs
- Currently on bench but outperforming most starters
- Consider starting him over Ricky Pearsall or Chris Olave

## Top Waiver Targets

### Priority 1: **Trey Benson, RB, ARI** ðŸŽ¯
**Why He's #1:**
- James Conner OUT FOR SEASON (ankle surgery)
- Immediate RB1 role in Arizona
- 8.3 PPG through 3 weeks as backup
- Clear path to 15+ touches per game
- 1M+ waiver adds (league-winner potential)

**Fantasy Outlook:**
- Week 4: 15+ touches expected vs SEA (Thursday)
- ROS: Legitimate RB2 with RB1 upside
- **FAAB Bid: 40-60%** (This is worth overpaying for)

### Priority 2: **Blake Corum, RB, LAR**
**Why Add:**
- McVay wants 65-35 split with Kyren Williams
- Averaging 6.1 PPG with growing role
- Scored first TD in Week 2
- Premium handcuff + standalone flex value
- If Kyren gets hurt, instant RB1

**Fantasy Outlook:**
- Week 4: 8-10 touches expected
- ROS: High-end handcuff with weekly flex appeal
- **FAAB Bid: 15-25%**

### Priority 3: **Chris Rodriguez, RB, WAS**
**Why Consider:**
- Austin Ekeler OUT for season (Achilles)
- 11 carries in Week 3 debut
- Goal-line role in improving offense
- Committee limits ceiling but TD upside

**Fantasy Outlook:**
- Week 4: TD-dependent flex
- ROS: Goal-line vulture in 3-way committee
- **FAAB Bid: 5-10%**

### Other Considerations:
- **Antonio Gibson (NE)**: Former starter, 3.6 PPG - desperation add only
- **Tre Tucker (WR, LV)**: 3M adds but we're overstocked at WR

## Drop Candidates

### Drop Priority 1: **Troy Franklin, WR, DEN**
- Averaging 11.7 PPG but wildly inconsistent (2.8, 24.0, 8.4)
- Lowest target share among bench WRs (6.3/game)
- Most expendable with our WR depth

### Drop Priority 2: **Brenton Strange, TE, JAX**
- Solid 8.9 PPG but we have Jake Ferguson
- Can't afford luxury of TE2 with zero RB depth
- Easy decision given critical RB need

### Hold These Players:
- **Quentin Johnston**: Elite 18.6 PPG, should be starting
- **Marvin Harrison Jr**: Talent + opportunity
- **Khalil Shakir**: Decent floor, Bills connection
- **Ricky Pearsall**: Breakout potential

## Recent Drops Analysis

No significant value in recent drops:
- Calvin Ridley (dropped by us) - Struggling at 6.4 PPG
- Chris Godwin, Daniel Jones, other committee backs
- Nothing worth pivoting for

## Final Recommendations ðŸ“‹

### WAIVER CLAIMS (in priority order):

**Claim 1:**
- **ADD**: Trey Benson, RB, ARI
- **DROP**: Troy Franklin, WR, DEN
- **FAAB**: 45%

**Claim 2:**
- **ADD**: Blake Corum, RB, LAR
- **DROP**: Brenton Strange, TE, JAX
- **FAAB**: 20%

**Claim 3 (if both above fail):**
- **ADD**: Chris Rodriguez, RB, WAS
- **DROP**: Brenton Strange, TE, JAX
- **FAAB**: 8%

### Lineup Adjustment:
- **START** Quentin Johnston over Chris Olave or Ricky Pearsall
- Johnston is your best bench player by far (18.6 PPG)

## Summary

**MUST MAKE MOVES THIS WEEK** - Zero RB depth is untenable. Trey Benson represents a rare league-winning opportunity with Conner done for the year. Blake Corum provides insurance and growing standalone value.

Our WR depth allows us to be aggressive dropping Franklin and Strange. This isn't the week to be conservative - grab RB depth before disaster strikes.

**Net Impact**: Adding 2 RBs transforms roster from dangerously thin to properly balanced for playoff push.
