# Week 5 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude

**Date:** October 2, 2025
**Record:** 3-1 (562 PF, 505 PA)
**Waiver Priority:** 7 of 10
**Current Week:** 5

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: STAY THE COURSE - NO WAIVER CLAIMS**

After comprehensive analysis of recently dropped players and trending waiver targets, there are no compelling opportunities that justify making a waiver claim this week. Our roster is in solid shape at 3-1, and the available players either:
- Are injured or on IR (Trey Benson, Jauan Jennings)
- Don't offer meaningful upgrades over current bench players
- Have immediate bye week issues limiting their value
- Are aging veterans in decline (Cooper Kupp, Kareem Hunt)

With waiver priority at 7 of 10, we should conserve our position for a more impactful claim later in the season.

## Current Roster Analysis

### Positional Breakdown

**Starters (Week 5):**
- **QB:** Josh Allen (BUF, bye 7) - 23.4 proj
- **RB1:** Jahmyr Gibbs (DET, bye 8) - 20.0 proj
- **RB2:** James Cook (BUF, bye 7) - 17.6 proj
- **WR1:** Marvin Harrison (ARI, bye 8) - 13.4 proj
- **WR2:** Chris Olave (NO, bye 11) - 12.4 proj
- **WR3:** Khalil Shakir (BUF, bye 7) - 11.4 proj
- **WR4:** Quentin Johnston (LAC, bye 12) - 14.5 proj
- **TE:** Jake Ferguson (DAL, bye 10) - 12.4 proj
- **K:** Matt Prater (BUF, bye 7) - 5.0 proj
- **DEF:** LAC - 6.4 proj

**Bench:**
- **WR:** DJ Moore (CHI, **bye 5**) - ON BYE
- **WR:** DeVonta Smith (PHI, bye 9) - 12.2 proj
- **WR:** Ricky Pearsall (SF, bye 14) - 3.1 proj (Questionable - knee)
- **RB:** TreVeyon Henderson (NE, bye 14) - 9.7 proj
- **RB:** Tyler Allgeier (ATL, **bye 5**) - ON BYE

### Positional Needs Assessment

1. **RB Depth: ADEQUATE**
   - Have 4 total RBs (Cook, Gibbs as studs, Henderson and Allgeier as depth)
   - Both starters are healthy and producing
   - Henderson provides upside if he takes over NE backfield
   - Allgeier is solid depth piece

2. **WR Depth: ADEQUATE**
   - Have 6 total WRs with good variety
   - Core starters (Harrison, Olave, Shakir, Johnston) all healthy
   - DJ Moore is quality depth
   - DeVonta Smith provides WR2 upside
   - Pearsall is developmental hold

3. **QB/TE/K/DEF: COVERED**
   - Josh Allen is a locked-and-loaded starter
   - Ferguson is top-12 TE
   - Streaming K/DEF as needed

### Critical Bye Week Considerations

**Week 7 (Upcoming):** Josh Allen, James Cook, Khalil Shakir all on bye - this is our biggest challenge
**Week 8:** Jahmyr Gibbs, Marvin Harrison both on bye

We may need to add a QB streamer for Week 7, but that decision should wait until next week's waiver period.

## Recently Dropped Player Analysis

### Tier 1: Injured/Unavailable
**Trey Benson (RB, ARI) - IR**
- **Status:** On IR with knee injury, depth chart order 7
- **Bye Week:** 8
- **Week 5 Projection:** 0.1 pts (OUT)
- **ROS Projection:** 128.0 pts
- **Analysis:** Currently on IR and not practicing. Even when healthy, he's 7th on the depth chart. No immediate value.
- **Verdict:** PASS

**Jauan Jennings (WR, SF) - Ankle Injury**
- **Status:** Out for Week 5 (Thursday night @ LAR)
- **Bye Week:** 14
- **Week 5 Projection:** 2.8 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 75.0 pts
- **Analysis:** Dropped today, but he's OUT for tonight's game with ankle injury. Even at full health, 75 ROS points is WR4/5 territory. Not worth a claim.
- **Verdict:** PASS

### Tier 2: Aging Veterans in Decline
**Cooper Kupp (WR, SEA) - Age 32**
- **Status:** Active, depth chart order 2
- **Bye Week:** 8 (SAME AS HARRISON/GIBBS)
- **Week 5 Projection:** 10.5 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 73.7 pts
- **Trending Context:** "Seeing increased usage and targets"
- **Analysis:** 32 years old, traded to Seattle, WR2 on depth chart. 73.7 ROS points is bottom-tier WR3/4. His bye week stacks with our two best players. Would need to drop someone better to roster him.
- **Verdict:** PASS - Age cliff + bye week conflict

**Kareem Hunt (RB, KC) - Age 30**
- **Status:** Active, RB2 behind starting running back
- **Bye Week:** 10
- **Week 5 Projection:** 8.8 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 69.7 pts (lower than TreVeyon Henderson's 92.0)
- **Trending Context:** "Seeing increased usage and targets"
- **Analysis:** 30-year-old backup RB. Henderson (already on our bench) projects for 92 ROS points vs Hunt's 69.7. Hunt doesn't offer an upgrade.
- **Verdict:** PASS

### Tier 3: Marginal Bench Pieces
**Dallas Goedert (TE, PHI)**
- **Status:** Questionable with knee injury
- **Bye Week:** 9
- **Week 5 Projection:** 9.3 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 72.3 pts (vs Ferguson's 71.8)
- **Analysis:** Essentially identical projection to Jake Ferguson, but currently dealing with knee injury. No reason to swap TEs.
- **Verdict:** PASS

**Rashid Shaheed (WR, NO)**
- **Status:** Active, WR2 on depth chart
- **Bye Week:** 11
- **Week 5 Projection:** 10.2 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 80.3 pts
- **Analysis:** Solid WR depth piece, but we already have 6 WRs rostered including DJ Moore (90.8 ROS) and DeVonta Smith (102.2 ROS). Would be our 7th WR.
- **Verdict:** PASS - Roster construction doesn't support 7 WRs

## Trending Waiver Targets

### Available Players with High Add Counts

**Justice Hill (RB, BAL)**
- **Add Count:** 1,019,025 (highest trending)
- **Status:** Active, RB2 on depth chart
- **Bye Week:** 7 (NEXT WEEK - same as Allen/Cook/Shakir)
- **Week 5 Projection:** 6.3 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 35.1 pts (vs Henderson's 92.0, Allgeier's 71.1)
- **Trending Context:** "Seeing increased usage and targets"
- **Analysis:** Hot name due to Derrick Henry injury concerns, but he's on bye NEXT WEEK when we already have 3 players on bye. ROS projection is terrible (35.1 pts). Pure handcuff with no standalone value.
- **Verdict:** PASS - Bye week conflict + inferior to our current RB depth

**Darius Slayton (WR, NYG)**
- **Add Count:** 981,864
- **Status:** Active, WR2 on depth chart
- **Bye Week:** 14
- **Week 5 Projection:** 9.0 pts
- **ROS Projection:** 71.8 pts
- **Trending Context:** "Seeing increased usage and targets"
- **Analysis:** WR2 on a struggling Giants offense. 71.8 ROS points would make him our WR6. We don't need a 7th wide receiver.
- **Verdict:** PASS

## Drop Candidate Analysis

### Current Bench Rankings by Dispensability

**1. Ricky Pearsall (WR, SF) - HOLD**
- **Week 5:** Questionable (knee), 3.1 proj
- **ROS:** 98.4 pts
- **Rationale:** Developmental hold with upside. Second-year player who could emerge in Kyle Shanahan's offense. Worth the bench spot as WR6.

**2. Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL) - HOLD**
- **Week 5:** On bye
- **ROS:** 71.1 pts
- **Rationale:** Solid RB3/4 depth. Atlanta runs the ball, and Bijan Robinson injury would make Allgeier valuable. Good hold at RB position.

**3. TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE) - HOLD**
- **Week 5:** 9.7 proj
- **ROS:** 92.0 pts
- **Rationale:** Just claimed last week via waiver priority. Rookie with potential to take over NE backfield. Higher ROS projection than most available options.

**4. DJ Moore (WR, CHI) - HOLD**
- **Week 5:** On bye
- **ROS:** 90.8 pts
- **Rationale:** Proven veteran WR2. Bears offense improving. Solid depth piece.

**5. DeVonta Smith (WR, PHI) - HOLD**
- **Week 5:** 12.2 proj
- **ROS:** 102.2 pts
- **Rationale:** High-end WR3 with WR2 upside. Elite offense. Clear hold.

### No Droppable Players Identified

All bench players have either:
- Higher ROS projections than available waiver options
- Developmental upside (Pearsall, Henderson)
- Proven track records (DJ Moore, DeVonta Smith)
- Position scarcity value (Allgeier as RB depth)

---

## Final Recommendations

### Priority Adds: NONE

**There are no waiver claims recommended this week.**

### Reasoning

1. **No Meaningful Upgrades Available**
   - Recently dropped players are either injured (Benson, Jennings), aging (Kupp, Hunt), or marginal (Goedert, Shaheed)
   - Trending players don't project better than our current bench

2. **Bye Week Conflicts**
   - Justice Hill (RB) is on bye Week 7 when we already have 3 starters on bye
   - Cooper Kupp (WR) is on bye Week 8 when Gibbs and Harrison are on bye
   - Adding players with immediate bye weeks reduces their value

3. **Strong Current Roster Construction**
   - 3-1 record with 562 points scored (good for 2nd in league)
   - 4 RBs providing adequate depth at scarcest position
   - 6 WRs with good variety of floor/ceiling profiles
   - All starters healthy and producing

4. **Waiver Priority Conservation**
   - Currently at priority 7 of 10 (middle of pack)
   - Better to save priority for impact claims (RB1 injury handcuff, breakout WR, etc.)
   - Week 7 bye week apocalypse may require streaming QB - save claims for then if needed

### Hold Recommendations

**Monitor These Situations:**
- **Ricky Pearsall's health:** If he clears injury and starts producing, could be league winner
- **TreVeyon Henderson's usage:** NE backfield could consolidate around rookie
- **Week 7 QB streaming:** May need to add backup QB for Josh Allen's bye (revisit next week)

### Free Agent Watchlist (Post-Waivers)

If any of these clear waivers and you need to make a speculative add:
- None recommended - stand pat with current roster

---

## Conclusion

**FINAL DECISION: NO WAIVER CLAIMS - STAY THE COURSE**

Our 3-1 start is no accident. The roster is balanced, healthy, and producing. The waiver wire this week offers nothing that meaningfully improves our championship odds.

Save the waiver priority. Focus on setting optimal lineups. Trust the process.

**Next Week's Action Items:**
- Monitor Week 7 bye week situation (Allen, Cook, Shakir all out)
- Evaluate QB streaming options for Week 7
- Continue monitoring Pearsall and Henderson development
