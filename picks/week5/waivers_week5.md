# Week 5 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude

**Date:** September 29, 2025
**Current Record:** 2-1
**Waiver Priority:** 4/10

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: STAND PAT - No waiver claims this week**

While there are interesting players available, none represent the league-winning upside necessary to justify using our #4 waiver priority. Our roster is healthy and performing well (2-1 record, 418 points scored). The best available options would only provide marginal upgrades to bench depth, not starting lineup improvements.

## Current Roster Assessment

### Position-by-Position Analysis

**Quarterback (1 starter, 0 bench)**
- **Starter:** Josh Allen (312.5 ROS projected)
- **Status:** Elite, no backup needed unless approaching bye week
- **Bye Week:** TBD (not within next 2 weeks)

**Running Back (2 starters, 3 bench)**
- **Starters:** James Cook (179.8 ROS), Jahmyr Gibbs (198.2 ROS)
- **Bench:** TreVeyon Henderson (96.7 ROS), Tyler Allgeier (71.3 ROS), Marvin Harrison Jr. moved to WR
- **Status:** ADEQUATE - Have 2 elite starters + 2 bench RBs (Henderson trending up, Allgeier touchdown-dependent)

**Wide Receiver (4 starters, 3 bench)**
- **Starters:** Ricky Pearsall (109.1 ROS, QUESTIONABLE - knee), DeVonta Smith (110.4 ROS), Chris Olave (91.7 ROS), Quentin Johnston (107.2 ROS)
- **Bench:** Marvin Harrison Jr. (113.4 ROS), DJ Moore (96.2 ROS), Khalil Shakir (82.4 ROS)
- **Status:** ADEQUATE - Deep at WR with 7 rostered, but Pearsall injury concern

**Tight End (1 starter, 0 bench)**
- **Starter:** Jake Ferguson (74.7 ROS)
- **Status:** ADEQUATE - TE streaming always available if needed

**Defense (1 starter, 0 bench)**
- **Starter:** LAC (114.2 ROS)
- **Status:** ADEQUATE - Can stream if needed

**Kicker (1 starter, 0 bench)**
- **Starter:** Matt Prater (6.5 ROS)
- **Status:** ADEQUATE - Kickers are replaceable

### Critical Needs Assessment

**Priority 1: NONE - Roster is healthy and deep**

**Priority 2: Monitor Ricky Pearsall's injury status**
- Questionable with knee injury for Thursday night game vs LAR
- If he's ruled out, we have adequate WR depth with Harrison Jr., Moore, and Shakir

**Priority 3: RB depth if elite opportunity emerges**
- We have 2 bench RBs (Henderson, Allgeier)
- Would only add RB for league-winning upside, not depth piece

## Waiver Wire Opportunities

### Recently Dropped Players (Last 7 Days)

**Top Considerations:**

1. **Rachaad White (RB, TB)** - Dropped 1 day ago
   - **Projection:** 6.7 PPG, 69.3 ROS
   - **Context:** Backup role to Bucky Irving, seeing reduced touches
   - **Analysis:** TD-dependent RB2 role. Would be our RB4. Not worth priority.
   - **Verdict:** PASS

2. **Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB, WAS)** - Dropped 5 days ago
   - **Projection:** 8.9 PPG, 95.1 ROS
   - **Context:** Washington backfield committee, increased usage
   - **Analysis:** Intriguing upside but murky backfield. Not clear starter path.
   - **Verdict:** PASS (monitor for free agency)

3. **Bhayshul Tuten (RB, JAX)** - Dropped 4 days ago
   - **Projection:** 7.0 PPG, 82.7 ROS
   - **Context:** Jacksonville backup RB seeing increased touches
   - **Analysis:** JAX offense struggling, not reliable. Would be RB4/5.
   - **Verdict:** PASS

4. **Green Bay Packers (DEF)** - Dropped 2 days ago
   - **Projection:** 7.3 PPG, 135.0 ROS
   - **Analysis:** Strong defense, but we have LAC (114.2 ROS). Not worth rostering 2 DEF.
   - **Verdict:** PASS

### Trending Available Players

1. **Kenneth Gainwell (RB, PIT)** - 492K adds
   - **Projection:** 12.9 PPG, 69.2 ROS
   - **Context:** Seeing increased usage and targets
   - **Analysis:** Would be our RB3 at best. Henderson (96.7 ROS) projects better long-term.
   - **Verdict:** PASS

2. **Romeo Doubs (WR, GB)** - 421K adds
   - **Projection:** 10.1 PPG, 74.2 ROS
   - **Context:** Seeing increased usage in GB offense
   - **Analysis:** Would be our WR6/7. We're already deep at WR with 7 rostered.
   - **Verdict:** PASS

## Drop Candidate Analysis

**If we were to make a move, our drop candidates would be:**

### Tier 1: Most Droppable
1. **Matt Prater (K)** - Kickers are completely streamable
2. **LAC Defense** - Defenses are streamable, especially with BYE weeks

### Tier 2: Questionable Value
3. **Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL)** - 71.3 ROS projected
   - **Stats:** 4 games, 29.9 total points (7.5 PPG)
   - **Concern:** TD-dependent backup (2 TDs on 43 carries)
   - **Efficiency:** 3.6 YPC - below league average
   - **Role:** Backup to Bijan Robinson
   - **Age:** 25 years old
   - **Analysis:** Boom/bust profile. Weeks 2 & 4 scored 15.0 and 11.1 (with TDs). Weeks 1 & 3 scored 2.4 and 1.4 (no TDs). Zero receiving upside (2 rec, 4 yards all season). Not an injury-away player - would split with others if Robinson went down.
   - **Verdict:** Prime drop candidate for the RIGHT add

4. **DJ Moore (WR, CHI)** - 96.2 ROS projected
   - **Stats:** 4 games, 38.8 total points (9.7 PPG)
   - **Concern:** Age 30 in declining Bears offense with rookie QB
   - **Target Share:** Only 21 targets in 4 games (5.25/game)
   - **Efficiency:** 16 rec on 21 targets (76% catch rate) but low volume
   - **Analysis:** Classic name-value hold. He's our WR6. Only scoring 9.7 PPG in PPR. Bears offense is anemic with Caleb Williams struggling. At 30 years old, this is the decline phase. Would we rather have Moore's projected 6-8 weekly points, or take a lottery ticket at RB (position of scarcity)?
   - **Verdict:** Should consider dropping for high-upside RB if one emerges

### Tier 3: Hold
5. **TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE)** - 96.7 ROS projected
   - **Stats:** Consistent 6-12 point range each week
   - **Role:** Lead back for New England
   - **Upside:** Young player with path to increased workload
   - **Verdict:** HOLD - legitimate RB depth

6. **Khalil Shakir (WR, BUF)** - 82.4 ROS projected
   - **Role:** Slot receiver in high-powered Buffalo offense
   - **Upside:** Connected with Josh Allen
   - **Verdict:** HOLD - useful WR depth

## Waiver Priority Cost Analysis

**Current Position:** 4/10
**Estimated Value of Priority:** ~20 points over rest of season

For a waiver claim to be worthwhile, we need:
- **Minimum 1.4 PPG improvement** (break-even threshold)
- **Expected value:** 49+ total points over 14 weeks (3.5+ PPG gain)

**Analysis:**
- Rachaad White replacing Allgeier: ~0 PPG improvement (69.3 vs 71.3 ROS)
- Kenneth Gainwell replacing Allgeier: ~0 PPG improvement (69.2 vs 71.3 ROS)
- Any WR replacing DJ Moore: Marginal at best

**Conclusion:** No available player meets the break-even threshold.

## Final Recommendation

### STAND PAT - Make NO waiver claims

**Rationale:**
1. **Roster is healthy and performing well** (2-1 record, 418 points)
2. **Position depth is adequate across the board**
   - QB: Elite starter (Allen)
   - RB: 2 elite starters + 2 bench pieces
   - WR: Deep with 7 rostered players
   - TE/K/DEF: Streamable positions
3. **No league-winning upside available**
   - Best available RBs (White, Gainwell, Croskey-Merritt) would be bench pieces
   - All project for 69-95 ROS points (5-7 PPG)
   - None are injury-away-from-bellcow situations
4. **Preserve waiver priority for better opportunity**
   - At #4, we're in good position for a true impact player
   - Week 5+ will bring injuries and role changes
   - Better to wait for a clear RB2/WR2 upgrade

### Monitoring for Free Agency (Post-Waivers)

If these players clear waivers, consider FREE AGENT adds (no priority cost):
1. **Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB, WAS)** - Drop Allgeier if needed
2. **Bhayshul Tuten (RB, JAX)** - Drop Allgeier if backfield clarifies

### Injury Watch

**Ricky Pearsall (Questionable - knee):**
- Monitor practice reports Tuesday/Wednesday
- Thursday night game vs LAR
- If ruled OUT, start Marvin Harrison Jr. in his place
- We have adequate WR depth to weather a 1-week absence

---

## Position-by-Position Priorities (For Future Weeks)

1. **RB** - Continue monitoring for injury-replacement or bellcow emergence
2. **WR** - Adequate depth, only add for clear WR2/3 upside
3. **QB/TE/K/DEF** - Stream as needed, never worth waiver priority

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Roster is in good shape** - 2-1 record with healthy starters
✅ **Deep at WR** - 7 rostered, can weather Pearsall injury concern
✅ **Adequate at RB** - 2 elite starters + 2 bench options
✅ **Preserve waiver priority** - #4 is valuable for future impact adds
❌ **Don't chase names** - DJ Moore and Tyler Allgeier are hold-or-drop candidates, not core pieces

**The patience play is the winning play this week. Save waiver priority for a true difference-maker.**
