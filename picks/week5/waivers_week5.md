## Roster Analysis & Critical Needs

### Position Breakdown
- **QB (CRITICAL NEED):** Josh Allen - **ZERO DEPTH** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Week 6 BYE coming - must add backup immediately
- **RB (ADEQUATE):** James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs, Blake Corum
- **WR (OVERSTOCKED):** 7 total (DJ Moore, DeVonta Smith, Chris Olave, Ricky Pearsall, Marvin Harrison, Khalil Shakir, Quentin Johnston)
- **TE (ADEQUATE):** Jake Ferguson, Brenton Strange
- **K:** Matt Prater (BUF - Week 6 BYE)
- **DEF:** Green Bay

### Key Discoveries
- **Quentin Johnston is KEEPING:** Averaging 18.6 PPG with 24 targets and 3 TDs through 3 weeks
- **Brenton Strange is VALUABLE:** 8.9 PPG with 16 targets - solid TE2 floor
- **Blake Corum:** Limited role behind Williams (6.1 PPG)

## Top Waiver Targets

### 1. **Trey Benson, RB, ARI** üö® **MUST ADD - LEAGUE WINNER POTENTIAL**
- **Situation:** James Conner suffered season-ending ankle surgery
- **Role:** Clear RB1 with 70%+ snap share expected
- **Stats:** 125 yards on 21 carries (6.0 YPC) + 8 catches through 3 games
- **Trending:** 289,848 adds in last 24 hours (8th most)
- **Projection:** 12.9 PPG with RB1 upside
- **Priority:** Use maximum FAAB if needed

### 2. **Geno Smith, QB, LV** - **QB STREAMING OPTION**
- **Stats:** 831 passing yards (2nd in NFL), explosive Week 3 (26.06 pts)
- **Week 4 Matchup:** vs CHI (favorable)
- **Projection:** 17.3 PPG
- **Value:** Short-term streaming with QB1 upside

### 3. **Matthew Stafford, QB, LAR** - **SAFE QB2 FLOOR**
- **Stats:** Steady 14.9 PPG average
- **Weapons:** Puka Nacua, Davante Adams
- **Projection:** 16.3 PPG
- **Value:** Reliable backup for Allen's Week 6 bye

### 4. **Chris Rodriguez, RB, WAS** - **SPECULATIVE ADD**
- **Situation:** RB2 behind Croskey-Merritt (Ekeler on IR)
- **Profile:** 6'2", 224 lbs goal-line back
- **Projection:** 7.0 PPG
- **Value:** Lottery ticket if starter gets hurt

### 5. **Kareem Hunt, RB, KC** - **COMMITTEE BACK**
- **Role:** Goal-line touches, scored Week 3 TD
- **Usage:** Increasing carries (5‚Üí8‚Üí10)
- **Projection:** 9.0 PPG
- **Concern:** Pacheco limits ceiling

## Drop Candidates Analysis

### 1. **Blake Corum** ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED DROP**
- Limited to backup role (14 carries in 3 games)
- 6.1 PPG average with minimal upside
- Rams' clear RB2 behind Williams

### 2. **Matt Prater** ‚ùå **KEEP**
- Elite kicker averaging 11 PPG
- On high-powered Bills offense
- Streaming kickers rarely better

### 3. **Brenton Strange** ‚ùå **KEEP**
- Surprisingly productive (8.9 PPG)
- 16 targets through 3 games
- Valuable TE depth

### 4. **Quentin Johnston** ‚ùå **DEFINITELY KEEP**
- **BREAKOUT ALERT:** 18.6 PPG, 24 targets, 3 TDs!
- Currently performing as WR2
- Would be foolish to drop

## Final Recommendations

### **PRIORITY WAIVER CLAIMS**

#### **Claim #1: ADD Trey Benson, DROP Blake Corum**
- **Rationale:** Potential league-winner with Conner out for season. Corum has minimal upside as LAR backup. This is a no-brainer upgrade at RB.
- **FAAB:** 40-50% (or more if needed)

#### **Claim #2: ADD Geno Smith, DROP Matt Prater**
- **Rationale:** CRITICAL need for QB backup with Allen's Week 6 bye approaching. Smith offers higher ceiling than Stafford. Can stream kickers later if needed.
- **FAAB:** 5-10%

### **Alternative if Claim #2 fails:**
- **ADD Matthew Stafford, DROP Matt Prater**
- Safe QB2 floor for bye week coverage

### **DO NOT PURSUE:**
- Chris Rodriguez (limited path to relevance)
- Kareem Hunt (committee limits upside)
- Calvin Ridley (recently dropped but not worth roster spot)

## Summary

**Make both waiver claims this week.** Trey Benson is a rare league-winning opportunity that cannot be missed. The QB backup is essential with Allen's bye approaching. Blake Corum is the clear drop with his limited role, and while dropping Prater hurts, QB depth takes priority over kicker in our situation.

**Net Impact:**
- Gain potential RB1 (Benson)
- Secure QB coverage for Week 6 bye
- Maintain strong roster depth at all positions

**Waiver Position:** Currently 9th (use aggressively for Benson)
