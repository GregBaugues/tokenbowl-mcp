‚è∫ üèà WEEK 3 WAIVER WIRE ANALYSIS - Bill Beliclaude

  Team Assessment (1-1 Record, 9th Waiver Priority)

  Strengths:
  - Elite QB (Josh Allen - untouchable)
  - Strong RB duo (Gibbs/Cook producing well)
  - Solid TE (Jake Ferguson averaging 12 PPG)

  Weaknesses:
  - WR inconsistency (DeVonta Smith 7 PPG, DJ Moore 9 PPG)
  - Bench depth lacking immediate impact players
  - Lost Week 2 by 35 points (120-155)

  Priority Waiver Targets

  üéØ TOP PRIORITY ADD:

  Ricky Pearsall (WR, SF) - MUST ADD
  - Averaging 12.0 PPR with 6.5 targets/game
  - SF's WR1 with Aiyuk on PUP, Jennings questionable
  - Clear upgrade over Keon Coleman (5.6 PPG last 2 weeks)
  - Drop: Keon Coleman

  Secondary Targets (if Pearsall claimed)

  Romeo Doubs (WR, GB)
  - 106k adds with Jayden Reed out 6-8 weeks
  - Not available - likely already rostered

  Kyle Monangai (RB, CHI)
  - Speculative add if Swift injured
  - Not worth dropping current players for speculation

  Drop Candidate Analysis

  Most Droppable:
  1. Keon Coleman - Declining production (25‚Üí6‚Üí5 points), buried on Bills depth chart behind your starter Khalil Shakir
  2. Calvin Ridley - Aging, inconsistent (7‚Üí9 points), poor Titans offense

  Hold:
  - Troy Franklin - Emerging (24 pts Week 2)
  - Quentin Johnston - 3 TDs in 2 games
  - Chris Olave - Too talented to drop despite slow start

  Recently Dropped Players Analysis

  Pass On:
  - Aaron Jones (IR 4+ weeks)
  - Brock Purdy (Toe injury, you have Allen)
  - Jordan Addison (Suspended)
  - Josh Downs (Poor production)
  - Quinshon Judkins (Speculative rookie)

  üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

  Make ONE Move:

  ADD: Ricky Pearsall
  DROP: Keon Coleman

  Rationale:
  - Pearsall offers immediate WR3/flex value with WR2 upside
  - Clear path to targets in SF offense
  - Coleman trending wrong direction on your own team
  - Net gain of ~6-7 PPG at flex position

  Hold Strategy:

  - Your core roster is solid
  - Don't overreact to one bad week
  - Save waiver priority if Pearsall gets claimed
  - Monitor Swift injury for Monangai next week

  Bottom Line: Only make a move for clear upgrades. Pearsall is the only player worth burning your #9 waiver priority on this week. If you miss him, stand pat and save priority
  for next week.
