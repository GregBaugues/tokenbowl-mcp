# Week 7 Waiver Wire Analysis - Bill Beliclaude

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Current Record:** 3-2
**Waiver Priority:** 6 of 10
**Current Week:** Week 6 (Week 7 waiver planning)

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: MAKE STRATEGIC WAIVER CLAIMS**

After comprehensive analysis of recently dropped players and trending targets, I recommend **making targeted waiver claims this week**. Elite players were mistakenly dropped (Romeo Doubs, Rachaad White), and we have a critical BYE week situation requiring immediate action.

## Defense Streaming Analysis

### Current: Cleveland Browns (6.4 projected Week 7, bye Week 9)

**Top 3 Streaming Options:**

1. **Green Bay Packers DEF** - 9.2 projected (+2.8 over CLE)
   - Already past bye (Week 5)
   - Elite defense available

2. **Denver Broncos DEF** - 8.3 projected (+1.9 over CLE)
   - Strong defense, bye Week 12

3. **Las Vegas Raiders DEF** - 7.9 projected (+1.5 over CLE)
   - Solid matchup-based play

**Recommendation:** Stream GB Defense for +2.8 points

---

## Waiver Priority Analysis

**Current Position:** 6/10
**Romeo Doubs Value:** 3+ PPG over WR7 = 36 points over 12 weeks
**Priority Value at #6:** 10.3 points
**Net Gain:** +25.7 points

**VERDICT: USE PRIORITY ON DOUBS**

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### PRIORITY WAIVER CLAIMS (in order):

1. **ADD Romeo Doubs (WR)** | DROP Tyler Allgeier
   - WR1 past bye, immediate starter
   - Worth using #6 priority

2. **ADD Rachaad White (RB)** | DROP Ricky Pearsall
   - RB1 coverage for Cook's bye
   - 22 reception upside

3. **ADD Brandon McManus (K)** | DROP Matt Prater
   - Required for bye week

### FREE AGENT PICKUPS (after waivers):

1. **ADD Green Bay DEF** | DROP Cleveland DEF
   - +2.8 point upgrade for Week 7

2. **ADD QB Streamer** (best available)
   - For Allen's bye week

### MONITOR LIST:
- Hassan Haskins (LAC handcuff lottery)
- Tucker Kraft (TE upgrade if available)
- Jacory Croskey-Merritt (suspicious projections but worth tracking)

---

## Summary

**This is a HIGH-ACTION week.** Romeo Doubs being dropped is a league-winning mistake by your opponent. A WR1 who already had his bye week should never be on waivers. Rachaad White provides perfect RB coverage for Cook's bye with excellent PPR upside.

**Priority Usage:** Worth using #6 priority for Doubs - the expected value far exceeds the priority cost.

**Total Moves:** 4-5 (active but strategic)

**Key Insight:** Sometimes the best waiver pickups aren't the trending players but the mistakenly dropped ones. Doubs and White are both starters who shouldn't be available.
