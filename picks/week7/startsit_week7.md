- **James Cook (RB)** - ON BYE WEEK 7

Both Buffalo players are unavailable this week with 0.0 projected points.

## Player-by-Player Analysis

### Quarterbacks

#### **Caleb Williams** (CHI vs NO) - 19.3 projected
**Player Capsule:** Fire up Caleb Williams with confidence in this primetime home matchup against a vulnerable Saints secondary. The rookie has shown dual-threat upside with 108 rushing yards and 2 TDs across 5 games, averaging 20.8 fantasy points per game and coming off a solid 20-point outing in Week 6. The Saints defense has struggled on the road, and with Chicago at home after extra rest, this screams breakout spot.

**Week Outlook:** **START**
**Ceiling:** 26 pts | **Floor:** 15 pts

#### **Josh Allen** (BUF) - BYE WEEK
**Player Capsule:** ON BYE THIS WEEK - Cannot start. Elite QB1 resting up during Buffalo's bye week. Hold through the bye as he's projected for 252 fantasy points rest of season.

**Week Outlook:** **ON BYE**
**Ceiling:** N/A | **Floor:** N/A

### Running Backs

#### **Jahmyr Gibbs** (DET vs TB, Monday Night) - 18.2 projected
**Player Capsule:** Lock and load Gibbs as an elite RB1 play despite last week's pedestrian 7.5 points, which stands as a clear outlier in his spectacular season. He's averaging 17.2 PPG with 5 total TDs and gets a Tampa defense that just allowed multiple rushing scores. Monday Night at home after extra rest is the perfect bounce-back spot for Detroit's explosive playmaker.

**Week Outlook:** **MUST START**
**Ceiling:** 28 pts | **Floor:** 12 pts

#### **Rachaad White** (TB @ DET, Monday Night) - 16.2 projected
**Player Capsule:** White has found his groove with 4 rushing TDs in his last 3 games, finally delivering on the volume that fantasy managers have craved all season. The Lions' high-powered offense should create negative game script early, potentially limiting touches, but his red zone role remains secure. His 15-target floor over 6 games provides PPR safety.

**Week Outlook:** **START**
**Ceiling:** 20 pts | **Floor:** 8 pts

#### **Jacory Croskey-Merritt** (WAS @ DAL) - 14.9 projected
**Player Capsule:** The volume is there for Croskey-Merritt as Washington's lead back, but the floor remains shaky after two fumbles in his last two games including a disappointing 5.8 points on 17 carries last week. He exploded for 27 points in Week 5, showcasing his ceiling, but Dallas at home represents a tougher test. Classic boom-or-bust RB2 in a divisional road game.

**Week Outlook:** **FLEX CONSIDERATION**
**Ceiling:** 22 pts | **Floor:** 6 pts

#### **Woody Marks** (HOU @ SEA, Monday Night) - 8.6 projected
**Player Capsule:** Proceed with extreme caution on Woody Marks, who profiles as a desperation flex play at best after his Week 4 explosion (27.9 pts) proved to be fool's gold. He's managed just 2.4 points since then and remains firmly behind D'onta Foreman in the pecking order, touching the ball only 7 times last week.

**Week Outlook:** **SIT**
**Ceiling:** 12 pts | **Floor:** 3 pts

#### **James Cook** (BUF) - BYE WEEK
**Player Capsule:** ON BYE THIS WEEK - Cannot start. Top-12 RB on bye week with 150+ projected points remaining. Mandatory hold for championship runs.

**Week Outlook:** **ON BYE**
**Ceiling:** N/A | **Floor:** N/A

### Wide Receivers

#### **Chris Olave** (NO @ CHI) - 14.4 projected
**Player Capsule:** Volume is king, and Olave's 10.7 targets per game make him virtually matchup-proof despite managing just one touchdown through 6 games. He's been Mr. Consistency with 57+ yards in 5 of 6 contests, and Chicago's secondary can be beaten deep. The Saints' struggling offense caps his ceiling, but the floor remains rock-solid.

**Week Outlook:** **START**
**Ceiling:** 22 pts | **Floor:** 10 pts

#### **DeVonta Smith** (PHI @ MIN) - 12.2 projected
**Player Capsule:** DeVonta's feast-or-famine pattern continues, alternating between 20-point explosions and single-digit duds, making him the ultimate variance play. He's coming off a quiet 8.9 points despite 5 targets, but Minnesota's aggressive defense could create quick-strike opportunities where he thrives.

**Week Outlook:** **FLEX CONSIDERATION**
**Ceiling:** 20 pts | **Floor:** 5 pts

#### **Quentin Johnston** (LAC vs IND) - 12.9 projected
**Player Capsule:** Johnston has been a revelation with 4 TDs in 5 games, but the target share (8.2 per game) suggests regression is coming after unsustainable TD luck. He's coming off a disappointing 6.9 points where he lost a fumble, and Indianapolis' defense has been stingy against WR2s. The red zone role keeps him relevant.

**Week Outlook:** **FLEX/START**
**Ceiling:** 20 pts | **Floor:** 4 pts

#### **Marvin Harrison Jr.** (ARI vs GB) - 11.5 projected ‚ö†Ô∏è **QUESTIONABLE**
**Player Capsule:** The concussion concern combined with Harrison's wildly inconsistent target share (ranging from 2 to 10) makes him a risky play even if he suits up. He managed just 5.2 points last week on 2 targets before the injury. Classic situation where you're chasing name value over recent production.

**Week Outlook:** **SIT**
**Ceiling:** 18 pts | **Floor:** 0 pts (injury risk)

#### **Ricky Pearsall** (SF vs ATL) - 5.8 projected ‚ö†Ô∏è **QUESTIONABLE**
**Player Capsule:** The knee injury (DNP Thursday) likely sidelines Pearsall who was averaging 13.1 PPG when healthy but hasn't played since Week 4. Even if active, the PCL issue severely caps both floor and ceiling in what would be a limited snap count return.

**Week Outlook:** **SIT**
**Ceiling:** 12 pts | **Floor:** 0 pts (injury risk)

### Tight End

#### **Jake Ferguson** (DAL vs WAS) - 12.6 projected
**Player Capsule:** Fire up Ferguson with supreme confidence as he's become Dallas' most reliable target, averaging 16.4 points per game with 4 TDs over his last 6 contests. The target share is elite (8.5 per game) and Washington's defense has been vulnerable to tight ends in divisional games.

**Week Outlook:** **MUST START**
**Ceiling:** 22 pts | **Floor:** 9 pts

### Kicker

#### **Harrison Butker** (KC vs LV) - 8.7 projected
**Player Capsule:** Lock and load Butker despite recent inconsistency (averaging just 8 points per game), as the Chiefs face a Raiders team that tends to force field goals in the red zone. Kansas City's offense should move the ball freely but may stall in scoring position. The 50+ yard bonus potential is always in play.

**Week Outlook:** **START**
**Ceiling:** 14 pts | **Floor:** 6 pts

### Defense

#### **Denver Broncos** (vs NYG) - 8.8 projected
**Player Capsule:** The Broncos defense is a top-tier play facing a Giants offense that has been a fantasy goldmine for opposing defenses. Denver's averaging 11 fantasy points per game at home and gets Daniel Jones who's prone to turnovers under pressure. This matchup screams double-digit fantasy points.

**Week Outlook:** **START**
**Ceiling:** 16 pts | **Floor:** 5 pts

## Final Recommended Lineup

### Starting Lineup (9 players):
- **QB:** Caleb Williams - 19.3 pts
- **RB1:** Jahmyr Gibbs - 18.2 pts
- **RB2:** Rachaad White - 16.2 pts
- **WR1:** Chris Olave - 14.4 pts
- **WR2:** Quentin Johnston - 12.9 pts
- **TE:** Jake Ferguson - 12.6 pts
- **FLEX:** Jacory Croskey-Merritt - 14.9 pts
- **K:** Harrison Butker - 8.7 pts
- **DEF:** Denver Broncos - 8.8 pts

**Total Projected Points: 126.0**

### Bench:
- DeVonta Smith (WR) - Consider if you want floor over ceiling
- Woody Marks (RB) - Clear sit, chasing points from Week 4
- Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR) - Sit due to injury concern
- Ricky Pearsall (WR) - Likely out with knee injury
- Josh Allen (QB) - ON BYE
- James Cook (RB) - ON BYE

## Key Lineup Changes & Rationale

1. **WR2: Quentin Johnston over DeVonta Smith**
   - Johnston's red zone role (4 TDs in 5 games) provides higher ceiling
   - Smith's boom/bust pattern makes him riskier in a must-win spot
   - Marginal decision - could go either way

2. **FLEX: Jacory Croskey-Merritt over Woody Marks**
   - Marks has collapsed since Week 4 explosion (27.9 pts)
   - Croskey-Merritt gets 15+ touches as lead back
   - 6.3 point projection advantage is significant

### Sunday 1:00 PM Games:
- Chris Olave @ CHI
- DeVonta Smith @ MIN

## Confidence Levels

- **HIGH CONFIDENCE:** Gibbs, Ferguson, Olave, White
- **MODERATE CONFIDENCE:** Williams, Croskey-Merritt, Johnston, Denver D
- **LOW CONFIDENCE:** Butker (inconsistent lately)

## Projected Score Range

- **Floor:** 105 points (if variance goes against us)
- **Expected:** 126 points (based on projections)
- **Ceiling:** 145 points (if Gibbs/Ferguson hit ceiling)

## Final Notes

- Monitor Harrison Jr. and Pearsall injury reports, but plan to bench both
- Consider pivoting to DeVonta Smith if you prefer floor over ceiling
- Denver defense is a strong hold - no streaming needed
- Monday Night triple-stack potential (Gibbs, White, Marks) provides exciting finish to week
- Josh Allen and James Cook return strong in Week 8
