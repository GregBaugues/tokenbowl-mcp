## üö® CRITICAL ALERT: FOUR STARTERS ON BYE üö®

Week 7 presents a **MAJOR ROSTER CRISIS** with four Buffalo Bills starters on bye:
- **Josh Allen (QB)** - Your QB1
- **James Cook (RB)** - Your RB1
- **Khalil Shakir (WR)** - Your WR3
- **Matt Prater (K)** - Your only kicker

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** You must acquire a QB and K from waivers **before Week 7** or you'll forfeit those positions entirely.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Good News
- **Jahmyr Gibbs** draws an elite matchup vs Tampa Bay (Monday Night)
- **Marvin Harrison Jr.** remains a must-start WR1 at home vs Green Bay
- Your bench WRs (**DJ Moore**, **DeVonta Smith**) step up with solid matchups

### The Bad News
- **No backup QB on roster** - Must stream
- **No backup K on roster** - Must stream
- **Four total starters unavailable** - Massive lineup holes

### The Game Plan
1. **Stream QB immediately** - Target Justin Herbert or Matthew Stafford
2. **Stream K immediately** - Target Chase McLaughlin or Chad Ryland
3. **Activate bench WRs** - DJ Moore and DeVonta Smith into starting lineup
4. **Start TreVeyon Henderson** - Fills RB2 slot with Cook out
5. **Hold Cleveland DEF** - Solid matchup vs Miami, no need to stream

**Projected Score:** 135-145 points (reduced from normal due to streaming QB)

## Individual Player Analysis

### ACTIVE STARTERS (6 players)

#### üîí Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR, ARI) - BYE WEEK 8
**Matchup:** vs GB (Week 7, Sunday 4:25 PM)
**Projected:** 13.3 pts (11.8-15.94 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **MUST START**

Fire up your WR1 with confidence as he faces Green Bay at home in what should be a high-scoring divisional showdown. Harrison has established himself as Kyler Murray's go-to target with elite separation ability, and the Packers' secondary has shown vulnerability to big plays this season. The 13.3 projected points feel conservative for a player with his ceiling in a dome environment where passing games thrive. Lock him in as a must-start WR1 with top-12 upside this week.

**Week 7 Outlook:** MUST START
**Ceiling/Floor:** High ceiling (20+ pts) / Safe floor (11+ pts)

---

#### üîí Jahmyr Gibbs (RB, DET) - BYE WEEK 8
**Matchup:** vs TB (Week 7, Monday Night 7:00 PM)
**Projected:** 20.0 pts (16.7-25.85 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **MUST START**

Lock and load your Monday night hammer as Gibbs gets a premium matchup against Tampa Bay's run-funnel defense. The Bucs have allowed the 5th-most fantasy points to running backs, and with Detroit favored by 7, game script should favor a heavy dose of Gibbs in the second half. His 20-point projection undersells his ceiling in what could be a 25+ touch masterpiece. This is your RB1 for the week and potential league-winner.

**Week 7 Outlook:** MUST START
**Ceiling/Floor:** Elite ceiling (30+ pts) / Rock-solid floor (15 pts)

---

#### ‚úÖ Jake Ferguson (TE, DAL) - BYE WEEK 10
**Matchup:** vs WAS (Week 7, Sunday 4:25 PM)
**Projected:** 12.4 pts (8.9-17.9 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **START**

The stars are aligning for a breakout performance as Ferguson draws Washington at home in a classic NFC East grudge match. With CeeDee Lamb demanding double coverage and Dak's trust growing weekly, Ferguson should feast on intermediate routes against a Commanders defense that's allowed the 8th-most points to tight ends. His 12.4-point projection reflects steady target share and red zone involvement. Start with confidence as a high-end TE1 this week.

**Week 7 Outlook:** START
**Ceiling/Floor:** Solid ceiling (18 pts) / Reliable floor (9 pts)

---

#### ‚úÖ Chris Olave (WR, NO) - BYE WEEK 11
**Matchup:** @ CHI (Week 7, Sunday 1:00 PM)
**Projected:** 12.7 pts (11.7-19.71 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **START**

Proceed with caution but don't overthink this revenge game narrative as Olave travels to Chicago for what should be a defensive struggle. The Bears' secondary has tightened up considerably, but Olave's target dominance (28% share) makes him matchup-proof in PPR formats. The 12.7 projection feels right for a player who's due for positive touchdown regression. Deploy as a solid WR2 with WR1 upside if he finds the end zone.

**Week 7 Outlook:** START
**Ceiling/Floor:** Moderate ceiling (20 pts) / Decent floor (10 pts)

---

#### ‚úÖ Quentin Johnston (WR, LAC) - BYE WEEK 12
**Matchup:** vs IND (Week 7, Sunday 4:05 PM)
**Projected:** 14.5 pts (6.3-20.0 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **START**

The matchup is too juicy to ignore as Johnston faces an Indianapolis defense hemorrhaging points to outside receivers. Herbert's deep ball has been money, and Johnston's emergence as the Chargers' WR1 coincides perfectly with a home game where they're 3-point favorites. The wide 6.3-20 point range reflects his boom-bust nature, but volume is king and he's getting fed. Fire him up as a high-upside WR3/flex with WR2 potential.

**Week 7 Outlook:** START
**Ceiling/Floor:** High ceiling (20+ pts) / Risky floor (6 pts)

---

#### ‚úÖ Cleveland DEF - BYE WEEK 9
**Matchup:** vs MIA (Week 7, Sunday 1:00 PM)
**Projected:** 7.1 pts (4.6-12.4 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **START - NO STREAM NEEDED**

This screams bounce-back spot against a Dolphins offense that's been a fantasy goldmine for opposing defenses. Miami's offensive line issues persist, and playing at home in potentially wet October weather favors Cleveland's pass rush. The 7.1 projection feels conservative for a unit that should generate multiple sacks and a turnover or two. Start with confidence as a top-10 defense play.

**Week 7 Outlook:** START
**Ceiling/Floor:** Decent ceiling (15 pts) / Safe floor (5 pts)

**Defense Streaming Analysis:**
- **Current DEF:** CLE vs MIA - 7.1 projected
- **Top Available:**
  1. BAL (unavailable - on bye Week 7)
  2. KC vs LV - 6.6 projected
  3. LAC vs IND - 6.3 projected
  4. DAL vs WAS - 6.3 projected
  5. DEN (6.1 pts) - Recently dropped

**RECOMMENDATION:** **HOLD CLEVELAND** - Your current defense projects better than all streaming options. The Miami matchup is too good to pass up.

---

### BYE WEEK PLAYERS (4 players - CANNOT START)

#### ‚ùå Josh Allen (QB, BUF) - **BYE WEEK 7**
**Projected:** 0.0 pts
**Status:** üö´ **ON BYE - MUST STREAM QB**

ON BYE THIS WEEK - Cannot start. Your QB1 takes a well-deserved rest in Week 7, creating a significant lineup hole to fill. This is a critical streaming week - target a quarterback with rushing upside to replicate Allen's dual-threat production.

**Week 7 Outlook:** ON BYE
**Ceiling/Floor:** N/A - Cannot start

---

#### ‚ùå James Cook (RB, BUF) - **BYE WEEK 7**
**Projected:** 0.0 pts
**Status:** üö´ **ON BYE - START HENDERSON**

ON BYE THIS WEEK - Cannot start. Your RB1 joins the Bills' bye week exodus, leaving a massive hole in your lineup's floor and ceiling. TreVeyon Henderson slides into RB2 role this week.

**Week 7 Outlook:** ON BYE
**Ceiling/Floor:** N/A - Cannot start

---

#### ‚ùå Khalil Shakir (WR, BUF) - **BYE WEEK 7**
**Projected:** 0.0 pts
**Status:** üö´ **ON BYE - ACTIVATE BENCH WRs**

ON BYE THIS WEEK - Cannot start. Buffalo's slot maven sits out Week 7, removing a reliable PPR option from your lineup. DJ Moore and DeVonta Smith fill the gap.

**Week 7 Outlook:** ON BYE
**Ceiling/Floor:** N/A - Cannot start

---

#### ‚ùå Matt Prater (K, BUF) - **BYE WEEK 7**
**Projected:** 0.0 pts
**Status:** üö´ **ON BYE - MUST STREAM K**

ON BYE THIS WEEK - Cannot start. The Bills kicker sits idle during their Week 7 bye, forcing you to stream a replacement from waivers immediately.

**Week 7 Outlook:** ON BYE
**Ceiling/Floor:** N/A - Cannot start

---

### BENCH PLAYERS ACTIVATED (2 players)

#### üîÑ DeVonta Smith (WR, PHI) - BYE WEEK 9
**Matchup:** @ MIN (Week 7, Sunday 1:00 PM)
**Projected:** 12.2 pts (11.2-15.1 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **START (FLEX)**

The stars are aligning for a breakout in Minnesota as Smith faces a Vikings secondary that's been torched by WR2s all season. His 12.2 projection reflects consistent target share despite A.J. Brown's dominance, and this road divisional matchup historically produces fireworks. Smith profiles as a strong WR3/flex play with WR2 upside if he hits pay dirt.

**Week 7 Outlook:** START (Flex)
**Ceiling/Floor:** Good ceiling (18 pts) / Reliable floor (9 pts)

---

#### üîÑ DJ Moore (WR, CHI) - BYE WEEK 5 (Active Week 7)
**Matchup:** vs NO (Week 7, Sunday 1:00 PM)
**Projected:** ~11-12 pts (estimated)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FLEX CONSIDERATION**

Classic trap game situation facing his former team as Moore returns from bye to host New Orleans. The Saints' defensive improvements are real, but Moore's target monopoly in Chicago's passing game (30% share when healthy) provides a safe floor. Without Week 7 projections available, historical data suggests 10-12 point expectation. He's your emergency WR3/flex with the Buffalo crew on bye.

**Week 7 Outlook:** FLEX CONSIDERATION
**Ceiling/Floor:** Moderate ceiling (18 pts) / Solid floor (8 pts)

---

### BENCH PLAYERS PROMOTED TO STARTER (1 player)

#### üîÑ TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE) - BYE WEEK 14
**Matchup:** @ TEN (Week 7, Sunday 1:00 PM)
**Projected:** 9.7 pts (9.0-13.1 range)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **START (RB2 with Cook out)**

Volume is king, and Henderson should see 12-15 touches in Nashville as the Patriots' early-down grinder. The Titans have been gashed on the ground, ranking 28th in run defense DVOA, setting up a potential stat-padding opportunity. His 9.7 projection reflects flex appeal, but with Cook on bye, he becomes your RB2 by necessity. Expect RB3/flex production with a safe floor.

**Week 7 Outlook:** START (Forced into RB2 role)
**Ceiling/Floor:** Modest ceiling (15 pts) / Decent floor (7 pts)

---

### REMAINING BENCH PLAYERS (2 players - SIT)

#### ü™ë Ricky Pearsall (WR, SF) - BYE WEEK 14
**Matchup:** @ SF (Week 7, Sunday Night)
**Projected:** 0.0 pts (0.0-13.0 range)
**Injury:** Knee - PCL (Inactive Week 5)
**Status:** ‚õî **SIT**

The PCL injury clouds his availability, making him a risky desperation play even if active. San Francisco's run-heavy approach and Pearsall's snap count limitations project minimal opportunity against Atlanta. His 0-point floor in projections tells the story - even if he suits up, you're chasing a prayer. Keep him stashed for future weeks but don't consider starting him.

**Week 7 Outlook:** SIT
**Ceiling/Floor:** Limited ceiling (10 pts) / Zero floor (0 pts)

---

#### ü™ë Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL) - BYE WEEK 5 (Active Week 7)
**Matchup:** @ SF (Week 7, Sunday Night 8:20 PM)
**Projected:** ~6-8 pts (estimated)
**Status:** ‚õî **SIT**

Bench with confidence in a brutal Sunday night matchup at San Francisco. The 49ers' run defense remains elite, and Allgeier's touchdown-dependent value evaporates against a team allowing the fewest rushing scores. Without projections post-bye, expect 5-7 point floor in a game where Atlanta will likely abandon the run early. He's purely a handcuff hold this week.

**Week 7 Outlook:** SIT
**Ceiling/Floor:** Low ceiling (10 pts) / Dangerous floor (3 pts)

---

## Waiver Wire Priorities

### üö® URGENT - MUST ADD BEFORE WEEK 7 üö®

#### Quarterback Streaming Options

You **MUST** acquire a QB from waivers. Top available options:

1. **Justin Herbert (LAC) - BEST OPTION**
   - **Projected:** 19.8 pts (16.0-21.3 range)
   - **Matchup:** vs IND (Week 7)
   - **Why:** Highest projection of available QBs, plus matchup, rushing floor
   - **Trending:** 170K+ adds (recently dropped, grab immediately)

2. **Matthew Stafford (LAR)**
   - **Projected:** 16.0 pts (14.1-21.0 range)
   - **Matchup:** @ JAC (Week 7, Saturday 9:30 AM London game)
   - **Why:** Solid floor, coming off 25.56 pt Week 5 performance
   - **Note:** Early kickoff (9:30 AM ET Saturday) for London game

3. **Michael Penix (ATL)**
   - **Projected:** Unknown (ROS: 198.5 pts)
   - **Matchup:** @ SF (Week 7, Sunday Night)
   - **Why:** High ROS projection suggests upside, but tough Week 7 matchup
   - **Risk:** Unproven, primetime road game vs elite defense

**RECOMMENDATION:** **Target Justin Herbert first, Stafford as backup plan.** Herbert's 19.8 projection nearly matches Allen's usual output and the Colts matchup is plus.

---

#### Kicker Streaming Options

You **MUST** acquire a K from waivers. Top available options:

1. **Chase McLaughlin (TB) - BEST OPTION**
   - **Projected:** 7.3 pts (1.2-8.6 range)
   - **Matchup:** @ DET (Week 7, Monday Night)
   - **Why:** Highest ROS projection (74.8), Bucs offense moves the ball
   - **Note:** Monday night insurance if you need points

2. **Chad Ryland (ARI)**
   - **Projected:** 7.5 pts (1.2-8.5 range)
   - **Matchup:** vs GB (Week 7)
   - **Why:** Home dome game, high-scoring matchup expected
   - **Risk:** Cardinals offense can stall in red zone

3. **Daniel Carlson (LV)**
   - **Projected:** 7.0 pts (0.9-9.0 range)
   - **Matchup:** @ KC (Week 7)
   - **Why:** Veteran kicker with range, though tough road game

**RECOMMENDATION:** **Chase McLaughlin** offers the best combination of projection and opportunity in a high-scoring Monday night game.

### Current vs Recommended Lineup

| Position | Current Starter | Status | Recommended Starter | Change |
|----------|----------------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| QB | Josh Allen | üö´ BYE | Justin Herbert (STREAM) | üîÑ **REQUIRED** |
| RB1 | Jahmyr Gibbs | ‚úÖ Active | Jahmyr Gibbs | ‚úÖ No Change |
| RB2 | James Cook | üö´ BYE | TreVeyon Henderson | üîÑ **REQUIRED** |

**Changes Required:** 4 forced by byes, 1 strategic flex swap

---

## Flex Decision Analysis

With **four Bills on bye**, your flex decision is simplified:

**FLEX OPTIONS:**
1. **DeVonta Smith (WR, PHI)** - 12.2 projected, @ MIN
2. **DJ Moore (WR, CHI)** - ~11-12 projected (estimated), vs NO

**WINNER: DeVonta Smith**

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Higher projection (12.2 vs ~11)
- ‚úÖ Better matchup (Vikings secondary vulnerable to WR2s)
- ‚úÖ Road divisional games favor passing volume
- ‚úÖ AJ Brown draws double coverage, opening targets for Smith
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Moore faces improved Saints defense at home

**Alternative:** You could flex DJ Moore instead if you prefer the home game and revenge narrative, but Smith has slightly better upside.

---

## Key Matchup Notes

### Elite Matchups to Exploit
- **Jahmyr Gibbs vs TB** - Bucs allow 5th-most fantasy points to RBs
- **Quentin Johnston vs IND** - Colts hemorrhaging points to outside WRs
- **Cleveland DEF vs MIA** - Dolphins O-line issues + weather = sack city

### Concern Matchups
- **TreVeyon Henderson @ TEN** - Low ceiling, but forced start with Cook out
- **Chris Olave @ CHI** - Tough Bears secondary, but target volume too high to bench

### Monday Night Considerations
- **Jahmyr Gibbs** (Mon 7:00 PM) - Your RB1 plays Monday, so you'll know standings
- **Chase McLaughlin** (Mon 7:00 PM) - If streaming this K, gives you Monday insurance

---

## Injury & Status Watch

### Players to Monitor

1. **Ricky Pearsall (WR, SF)** - Knee (PCL)
   - Status: Inactive Week 5
   - Monitor: Check practice reports Week 6-7
   - Action: Keep benched even if active

2. **Joe Burrow (QB, CIN)** - Toe (IR)
   - Status: On Injured Reserve
   - Expected Return: Week 15
   - Note: Available on waivers if needed for playoffs

---

## Week 7 Action Items

### IMMEDIATE (Before Week 6 Waivers Close)
- [ ] **DROP:** Matt Prater (K, BUF) - On bye, need replacement
- [ ] **ADD:** Justin Herbert or Matthew Stafford (QB streaming)
- [ ] **ADD:** Chase McLaughlin or Chad Ryland (K streaming)

### WEEK 7 LINEUP CHANGES
- [ ] **ACTIVATE:** DeVonta Smith to FLEX
- [ ] **ACTIVATE:** TreVeyon Henderson to RB2
- [ ] **ACTIVATE:** Chris Olave to WR3 (moving from FLEX)
- [ ] **BENCH:** Josh Allen (bye)
- [ ] **BENCH:** James Cook (bye)
- [ ] **BENCH:** Khalil Shakir (bye)
- [ ] **BENCH:** Matt Prater (bye)
- [ ] **BENCH:** DJ Moore (alternate flex option)

### OPTIONAL (Week 7 or Later)
- [ ] **MONITOR:** Ricky Pearsall injury status for Week 8+
- [ ] **CONSIDER:** Holding Justin Herbert if he has better Week 8 matchup than Allen's return

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Confidence (90%+)
- ‚úÖ Jahmyr Gibbs smashes TB defense
- ‚úÖ Marvin Harrison remains WR1 in Arizona
- ‚úÖ Jake Ferguson sees 6+ targets vs Washington

### Medium Confidence (70-80%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Herbert/Stafford stream provides 15+ points
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DeVonta Smith outscores DJ Moore in flex
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cleveland DEF generates 2+ sacks vs Miami

### Low Confidence / Risk Areas (50-60%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TreVeyon Henderson reaches 10+ points (low ceiling RB3)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quentin Johnston hits ceiling (boom/bust 6-20 range)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chris Olave finds end zone vs tough Bears D

---

## Score Projection & Outlook

**Projected Score Range:** 125-145 points

**Breakdown:**
- **Best Case (145 pts):** Herbert goes off (25), Gibbs hits ceiling (30), Johnston booms (20)
- **Expected (135 pts):** Solid contributions across lineup, streaming QB provides 16-19
- **Worst Case (125 pts):** Henderson flops (6), Johnston busts (6), streaming QB struggles (12)

**Opponent Considerations:**
- Check your Week 7 opponent's roster for bye weeks
- If opponent also has major byes, your chances improve significantly
- If opponent has full roster, you'll need ceiling outcomes (Herbert 20+, Gibbs 25+)

---

## Final Recommendations

### Must-Do Actions
1. **Stream QB:** Justin Herbert (top choice) or Matthew Stafford (backup)
2. **Stream K:** Chase McLaughlin (top choice) or Chad Ryland (backup)
3. **Drop Matt Prater** to make room (or drop Tyler Allgeier if you prefer)
4. **Activate DeVonta Smith** to flex position
5. **Activate TreVeyon Henderson** to RB2 position

### Strategic Considerations
- This is a **survival week** with 4 starters on bye
- Focus on **floor over ceiling** with streaming adds
- **Hold Josh Allen** - Don't panic drop your QB1
- **Hold James Cook** - He's your RB1 for ROS
- Consider this a **punt week** if your opponent has full roster
- **Monday Night Factor:** Gibbs plays Monday, gives you sweat if you're close

### Rest of Season Notes
- Week 8: **Marvin Harrison** and **Jahmyr Gibbs** on bye (plan ahead)
- Week 9: **Cleveland DEF** on bye (stream that week)
- Week 10: **Jake Ferguson** on bye (have TE streaming plan)
- Your core (Allen, Cook, Harrison, Gibbs) returns strong after Week 7

---

## Confidence Level: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5 Stars)

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Strong core when healthy (Allen, Gibbs, Harrison)
- ‚úÖ Elite RB1 matchup (Gibbs vs TB)
- ‚úÖ Solid defense streaming hold (CLE vs MIA)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **FOUR starters on bye significantly weakens ceiling**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Forced to stream QB/K (variance risk)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Henderson at RB2 lacks upside (9.7 projection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bench depth tested with WR3/Flex options

**Bottom Line:** This is a **survival week**. If you can escape 3-2 or 4-1, you'll be in excellent shape when your Bills return for Week 8 and beyond. Don't panic‚Äîmanage the bye week well, make smart streaming adds, and trust your studs (Gibbs, Harrison).
