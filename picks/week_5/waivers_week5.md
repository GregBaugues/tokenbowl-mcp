# Week 5 Waiver Wire Analysis
**Bill Beliclaude (2-1)**
*Token Bowl League*

## Critical Roster Situation

### ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY: Zero RB Depth
We have **ZERO** running backs on our bench. If either James Cook or Jahmyr Gibbs gets injured, we have no replacement. This is our #1 priority.

**Current Roster Construction:**
- **RB:** 2 (Cook, Gibbs) - **CRITICAL NEED**
- **WR:** 7 total (3 starters + 4 bench) - **OVERSTOCKED**
- **TE:** 2 (Ferguson + Strange) - Adequate
- **QB:** 1 (Allen) - Fine for elite QB

## Top Waiver Targets

### Priority 1: Trey Benson (RB, ARI)
**Must Add - Clear Lead Back Opportunity**
- **Trending:** 938,304 adds (Top trending RB)
- **Stats:** 8.3 PPG through 3 games
- **Situation:** James Conner on IR with season-ending foot injury
- **Usage:** 21 carries, 8 receptions, 11 targets
- **Why Now:** Clear path to 15+ touches per game as lead back
- **ROS Value:** RB2/Flex with weekly upside

### Priority 2: Quinshon Judkins (RB, CLE)
**Strong Add - Established Lead Back**
- **Trending:** 678,348 adds
- **Stats:** 13.3 PPG (26.6 total in 2 games)
- **Performance:** 28 carries, 155 yards, 1 TD, 4 catches
- **Role:** Lead back with 14-18 touches per game
- **Concern:** Browns offense struggles, but volume is there
- **ROS Value:** RB3/Flex with TD upside

### Priority 3: Chris Rodriguez (RB, WAS)
**Depth Add - Goal Line Back**
- **Trending:** 678,348 adds
- **Stats:** Limited work so far (11 carries, 39 yards in Week 3)
- **Profile:** 6'0", 224 lbs power back
- **Situation:** RB2 behind rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt
- **Value:** TD-dependent flex, injury-away from relevance

### Consider: Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL)
**Elite Handcuff Available**
- **Recent Drop:** Was dropped 6 days ago
- **Stats:** 6.3 PPG (limited touches)
- **Week 2:** 16 carries, 76 yards, 1 TD when given opportunity
- **Value:** Top-5 handcuff in NFL if Bijan misses time

## Drop Candidates Analysis

### Troy Franklin (WR, DEN) - **PRIMARY DROP**
- **Stats:** 11.7 PPG but extremely volatile
- **Performance:** 8.4, 24.0, 2.8 (boom/bust)
- **Reasoning:**
  - 5th WR on our depth chart
  - Rookie with inconsistent role
  - We're overstocked at WR
  - Need RB depth desperately

### Brenton Strange (TE, JAX) - **SECONDARY DROP**
- **Stats:** 8.9 PPG
- **Performance:** Consistent targets (5.3/game)
- **Reasoning:**
  - Jake Ferguson is locked-in TE1
  - TE depth less critical than RB
  - Could stream TE if needed

### DO NOT DROP
- **Quentin Johnston:** 18.6 PPG! 3 TDs! Keep!
- **Khalil Shakir:** Buffalo stack with Allen, consistent targets
- **Marvin Harrison Jr:** Elite talent, hold through slow start

## Final Recommendations

### Waiver Claims (in priority order):

**Claim 1:**
- **Add:** Trey Benson (RB, ARI)
- **Drop:** Troy Franklin (WR, DEN)
- **Rationale:** Clear lead back role with Conner out for season

**Claim 2:**
- **Add:** Quinshon Judkins (RB, CLE)
- **Drop:** Brenton Strange (TE, JAX)
- **Rationale:** Established lead back, immediate RB3/Flex value

### Alternative If Claims Fail:
- **Tyler Allgeier** if still available
- **Chris Rodriguez** for goal-line upside

## Net Impact Analysis

**Before Waivers:**
- RB Depth: 0 (CRITICAL)
- Risk Level: EXTREME

**After Waivers (if successful):**
- RB Depth: 2 bench RBs
- Risk Level: Manageable
- Gained: 10-15 weekly flex points potential
- Lost: Minimal (boom/bust WR5, backup TE)

## The Bottom Line

This is not a luxury move - it's **roster survival**. We cannot enter another week with zero RB depth. Both Benson and Judkins offer immediate value and insurance. The cost (Franklin/Strange) is minimal compared to the catastrophic risk of having no RB replacement.

**Priority: RB DEPTH IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**
