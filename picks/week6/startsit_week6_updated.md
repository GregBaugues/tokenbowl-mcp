## Week 7 Preparation Alert

### CRITICAL BYE WEEK IMPACTS
**Players on BYE Week 7:**
- Josh Allen (QB) - Need streaming QB
- James Cook (RB) - Major RB hole
- Khalil Shakir (WR) - Bench impact
- Matt Prater (K) - Need replacement

**Waiver Wire Targets for Week 7:**
- **QB:** Derek Carr, Baker Mayfield, Aidan O'Connell
- **RB:** Check for handcuffs, volume plays

Focus on:
1. Checking Johnston status Sunday morning
2. Enjoying the Monday night hammer
3. Preparing Week 7 waiver claims for the Buffalo bye week

**Projected Score: 148.6 points**
