## Individual Player Analysis

### MUST START TIER

**Josh Allen (QB, BUF) @ ATL (Monday Night)**
- **Bye Week:** 7 (next week)
- **Projection:** 23.4 points
- **Analysis:** Elite dual-threat QB averaging 24.9 PPG over last 3 games with 10 total TDs. Monday night @ ATL presents prime opportunity against defense allowing 8th-most fantasy points to QBs. His 159 rushing yards and 3 rushing TDs provide elite floor.
- **Outlook:** MUST START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

**James Cook (RB, BUF) @ ATL (Monday Night)**
- **Bye Week:** 7 (next week)
- **Projection:** 17.6 points
- **Analysis:** Averaging 22.8 PPG with 20+ points in every game this season. 5 rushing TDs through 4 games with consistent passing work (3 catches/game). Atlanta's defense is vulnerable to RBs.
- **Outlook:** MUST START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

**Jahmyr Gibbs (RB, DET) @ KC (Sunday Night)**
- **Bye Week:** 8
- **Projection:** 20.0 points
- **Analysis:** PPR monster averaging 19.8 PPG with elite efficiency (20 catches on 21 targets). Sunday night @ KC could be a shootout favoring Gibbs' explosive skill set. Found end zone in 3 of 4 games.
- **Outlook:** MUST START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

---

### SOLID START TIER

**Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR, ARI) @ IND**
- **Bye Week:** 8
- **Projection:** 13.3 points
- **Analysis:** Coming off best game (18.6 points on 6/66/1) after slow start. 27 targets through 4 games shows WR1 status. Indianapolis ranks middle-of-pack vs WRs. Positive momentum suggests he's turning the corner.
- **Outlook:** START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

**Quentin Johnston (WR, LAC) @ MIA**
- **Bye Week:** 12
- **Projection:** 14.5 points
- **Analysis:** Justin Herbert's favorite target with elite 9.3 targets/game and 4 TDs through 4 games. Scored 14.9+ in every game. Miami's secondary exploitable (24th vs WRs). Locked-in WR2 with WR1 upside.
- **Outlook:** START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

**Jake Ferguson (TE, DAL) @ CAR**
- **Bye Week:** 10
- **Projection:** 12.4 points
- **Analysis:** Incredibly consistent with 15.6 PPG average and 8.5 catches/game on nearly 10 targets. Posted 16+ in 3 of 4 games. Leads all Cowboys in targets (39). Carolina generous to TEs.
- **Outlook:** START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

**Matt Prater (K, BUF) @ ATL (Monday Night)**
- **Bye Week:** 7 (next week - will need replacement)
- **Projection:** 8.8 points
- **Analysis:** Benefits from Buffalo's high-powered offense. Monday night in Atlanta dome eliminates weather concerns. Veteran reliability on elite offense.
- **Outlook:** START
- **Decision:** ‚úÖ START

---

### FLEX DECISION

**Current Starters in Flex:**
- Chris Olave (WR, NO) - Projected: 12.7
- Khalil Shakir (WR, BUF) - Projected: 11.3

**Bench Options:**
- ~~DJ Moore (WR, CHI)~~ - **ON BYE** (Bye Week 5, Projected: 0.0)
- DeVonta Smith (WR, PHI) - Projected: 12.2
- TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE) - Projected: 9.7

**Analysis:**

**Chris Olave (WR, NO) vs NE** - Projected: 12.7
- **Pros:** Target vacuum (10.8/game), 43 targets through 4 games, solid PPR floor with 26 catches
- **Cons:** Saints QB instability, only 1 TD, New England's stout defense vs WRs, low efficiency
- **Outlook:** FLEX CONSIDERATION - Volume play with concerning matchup
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **START in FLEX** - Best available option with DJ Moore on bye

**Khalil Shakir (WR, BUF) @ ATL** - Projected: 11.3
- **Pros:** Josh Allen connection, scored TDs in 2 of last 3 games, 80% catch rate, Monday night environment
- **Cons:** Low target volume (5/game), TD-dependent ceiling
- **Outlook:** FLEX CONSIDERATION - Efficient but low volume
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **START in FLEX** - Allen stack on Monday night provides upside

**DeVonta Smith (WR, PHI) @ NYG (Thursday Night)** - Projected: 12.2
- **Bye Week:** 9
- **Pros:** Elite talent, Thursday night division game, exploitable NYG secondary
- **Cons:** Wildly inconsistent (4.6, 9.3, 20.0, 4.9 weekly scores), A.J. Brown dominates targets
- **Outlook:** FLEX CONSIDERATION - High variance play
- **Recommendation:** ü§î **BENCH** - Too inconsistent vs Olave's volume floor

**DJ Moore (WR, CHI) @ WAS** - **ON BYE WEEK 5**
- **Bye Week:** 5 (THIS WEEK)
- **Projected:** 0.0 points
- **Outlook:** ON BYE - Cannot start
- **Recommendation:** üö´ **CANNOT START** - On bye this week

---

### SIT/BENCH TIER

**TreVeyon Henderson (RB, NE) @ NO**
- **Bye Week:** 14
- **Projection:** 9.7 points
- **Analysis:** Tough road matchup in New Orleans. Patriots likely playing from behind. Saints allow 7th-fewest points to RBs. Game script concerns limit upside.
- **Outlook:** BENCH/HOLD
- **Decision:** üö´ SIT

**Tyler Allgeier (RB, ATL) vs BUF** - **ON BYE WEEK 5**
- **Bye Week:** 5 (THIS WEEK)
- **Projected:** 0.0 points
- **Analysis:** ON BYE THIS WEEK. Even if active, stuck behind Bijan Robinson with limited touches.
- **Outlook:** ON BYE
- **Decision:** üö´ CANNOT START

**Ricky Pearsall (WR, SF) @ TB**
- **Bye Week:** 14
- **Projection:** 0.0 (expected return from injury)
- **Analysis:** Expected to return from knee PCL injury. Unknown role and snap count in crowded 49ers WR corps. Monitor usage this week.
- **Outlook:** BENCH/HOLD
- **Decision:** üö´ SIT

---

## Defense Streaming Analysis

**Current Defense:**
- **LAC @ MIA** - Projected: 6.3 points
- **Concern:** Tough road matchup, Tua efficient at home, Miami's explosive offense

**Available Streaming Options:**

| Defense | Matchup | Week 6 Proj | ROS Proj | Bye Week | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **LAR** | vs BAL | **7.4** | 99.4 | 8 | ‚≠ê BEST STREAM |
| **CLE** | @ PIT | **7.1** | 107.3 | 9 | ‚≠ê STRONG STREAM |
| **DEN** | @ NYJ | **6.1** | 131.2 | 12 | ‚≠ê GOOD STREAM (recently dropped!) |
| NYG | vs PHI (Thu) | 6.5 | 94.3 | 14 | OPTIONAL |
| NO | vs NE | 6.5 | 87.7 | 11 | OPTIONAL |
| SEA | @ JAX | 6.5 | 105.3 | 8 | OPTIONAL |
| BAL | @ LAR | 6.6 | 93.1 | 7 | OPTIONAL |
| KC | vs DET | 6.6 | 109.0 | 10 | OPTIONAL |
| MIA | vs LAC | 6.4 | 88.5 | 12 | OPTIONAL |
| DAL | @ CAR | 6.3 | 78.6 | 10 | NEUTRAL |

**Streaming Recommendation:**

### ‚≠ê STRONG RECOMMEND: Stream LAR, CLE, or DEN

**Option 1: LA Rams (LAR) vs BAL** - Projected: 7.4 (+1.1 over LAC)
- **Why:** Home matchup, highest projection, solid ROS value (99.4)
- **Concern:** Bye Week 8 (but so does our Gibbs/Harrison, manageable)
- **Add Priority:** #1 choice

**Option 2: Cleveland Browns (CLE) @ PIT** - Projected: 7.1 (+0.8 over LAC)
- **Why:** Division rivalry game, strong projection, excellent ROS (107.3)
- **Concern:** Road game at Pittsburgh
- **Add Priority:** #2 choice

**Option 3: Denver Broncos (DEN)** - Projected: 6.1 (neutral vs LAC)
- **Why:** RECENTLY DROPPED in our league! Elite ROS projection (131.2), Bye Week 12 matches our LAC/Johnston
- **Concern:** Slightly lower Week 6 projection, but long-term upgrade
- **Add Priority:** #3 choice (best ROS value if thinking ahead)

**Decision:**
‚úÖ **DROP LAC** for **LAR** (best Week 6 matchup)
- Or consider DEN for long-term value (131.2 ROS is elite, recently dropped by opponent)

## Key Decisions Summary

### ‚úÖ NO LINEUP CHANGES NEEDED (Position Players)

The original starting lineup is correct for Week 6:
- All starters are active (not on bye)
- Best available options are already in lineup
- DJ Moore cannot replace Olave because he's on bye

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFENSE CHANGE RECOMMENDED

**RECOMMENDED MOVE:**
1. **DROP:** LAC Defense (6.3 proj, tough @ MIA)
2. **ADD:** LA Rams Defense (7.4 proj, home vs BAL)
   - Alternative: CLE (7.1 proj) or DEN (131.2 ROS, recently dropped!)

**Confidence Level:** 80% - LAR projects +1.1 points higher and has favorable home matchup

---

## Apology and Correction

**Original Error:** The initial analysis incorrectly recommended starting DJ Moore in the flex position, missing that he is on Bye Week 5 and has 0.0 projected points.

**Root Cause:** Failed to check the `bye_week` field in player data against the current week.

**Fix Implemented:**
1. Updated `/startsit` command with explicit bye week checking requirements
2. Added critical rules section emphasizing bye week validation
3. Updated waivers command to include defense/kicker streaming analysis

**Correct Recommendation:** Keep current lineup with Chris Olave and Khalil Shakir in WR3/FLEX spots. Stream LAR defense over LAC.

---

## Week 6 Outlook

**Projected Score:** 140.4 points (with LAR DEF stream)
**Win Probability:** High

**Keys to Victory:**
1. Elite RB duo (Cook + Gibbs) should combine for 35-40 points
2. Josh Allen Monday night primetime performance
3. Stream LAR defense for +1.1 point upgrade
4. Jake Ferguson volume continues

**Next Week Concerns:**
- **Week 7 Bye Week Impact:** Josh Allen, James Cook, Khalil Shakir, Matt Prater all on bye
- Will need to stream K and potentially adjust lineup significantly
