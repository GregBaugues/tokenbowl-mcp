**Record:** 3-2
**Key Crisis:** Only 2 RBs on roster (Cook, Gibbs) with bye weeks approaching

### Top 3 Moves (PRIORITY ORDER)
1. **ADD Jacory Croskey-Merritt** ‚Üí DROP Tyler Allgeier (Week 7 RB need + ROS upside)
2. **ADD Rachaad White** ‚Üí DROP TreVeyon Henderson (Week 7 starter if Irving still out)
3. **STREAM Green Bay DEF** ‚Üí DROP Cleveland DEF (Week 6 gain: +2.8 points)

---

## Team Needs Analysis

### Current Roster Construction
- **QB (1):** Josh Allen (BYE Week 7) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **RB (2):** James Cook (BYE 7), Jahmyr Gibbs (BYE 8) - **CRITICAL SHORTAGE**
- **WR (7):** MHJ, Olave, Shakir (BYE 7), Q. Johnston, DJ Moore (BYE passed), DeVonta, Pearsall (Q)
- **TE (1):** Jake Ferguson
- **K (1):** Matt Prater (BYE Week 7) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **DEF (1):** Cleveland (BYE 9)

### RB Depth Analysis (CRITICAL)
- **Tyler Allgeier:** Bench RB, 68.3 ROS (5.7 PPG) - Clear backup to Bijan
- **TreVeyon Henderson:** Bench RB, 83.6 ROS (7.0 PPG) - Stuck in NE committee

### Immediate Concerns
1. **RB Depth Crisis:** Only 2 true RBs! Gibbs BYE Week 8, Cook BYE Week 7
2. **Week 7 BYE Hell:** Allen, Cook, Shakir, Prater all on BYE
3. **Bench Dead Weight:** Allgeier and Henderson offering minimal upside

## Priority Adds (Week 7 RB Crisis Focus)

### 1. **Jacory Croskey-Merritt, RB, WAS** üéØ TOP PRIORITY
- **Status:** Available, trending (595,512 adds!)
- **Week 7 Value:** Playable RB2 when Cook on BYE
- **Current:** 12.2 PPG projection
- **ROS Projection:** 116.8 total (9.7 PPG)
- **Context:** Brian Robinson traded to SF. JCM ran for 111 yards on 14 carries vs LAC. Committee with Ekeler, but he's getting goal-line work.
- **Drop:** Tyler Allgeier (only 5.7 PPG, won't start)
- **Net Gain:** Solves Week 7 RB crisis + lottery ticket upside

### 2. **Rachaad White, RB, TB** üí∞ WEEK 7 INSURANCE
- **Status:** Dropped 4 days ago
- **Week 7 Value:** If Irving still out, instant RB2
- **Current:** 13.6 PPG when Irving out
- **ROS:** 67.7 total (handcuff value)
- **Analysis:** Two TDs in Week 5 with Irving out. Monitor Irving's status closely. Better Week 7 play than Henderson.
- **Drop:** TreVeyon Henderson (stuck in committee)
- **Verdict:** CLAIM for Week 7 emergency

### 3. **Isiah Pacheco, RB, KC** üè• STASH IF POSSIBLE
- **Status:** Dropped 4 days ago, returning from injury
- **Week 7 Value:** Unknown return timeline
- **ROS:** 72.9 total when healthy
- **Analysis:** Could be back by Week 7-8, would be RB1 in KC
- **Verdict:** Add if you get JCM/White first

### 4. **Romeo Doubs, WR, GB** üìâ LUXURY ADD
- **Status:** Dropped 1 day ago
- **Current:** 10.8 PPG projection
- **Analysis:** Great value but WR isn't your need. You have 7 WRs already!
- **Verdict:** PASS - Focus on RB crisis first

### 5. **Hassan Haskins, RB, LAC** ‚ö° DESPERATION PLAY
- **Haskins:** 3.4M adds! Could start Week 7
- **Situation:** 50/50 timeshare but getting goal-line work
- **Week 7:** Has CAR (decent matchup)
- **Recommendation:** Last resort if you miss JCM/White

---

## Recently Dropped Players Analysis

### Worth Monitoring
- **Mike Evans, WR, TB** - OUT, but 104.6 ROS when healthy
- **Isiah Pacheco, RB, KC** - 72.9 ROS, returning from injury
- **Tucker Kraft, TE, GB** - 86.9 ROS (comparable to Ferguson)
- **Nick Chubb, RB, HOU** - BYE Week 6, only 56.1 ROS

---

## Drop Candidates Analysis

### Primary Drops
1. **Tyler Allgeier** - 68.3 ROS (5.7 PPG) - Clear RB2 in ATL, limited ceiling
2. **TreVeyon Henderson** - 83.6 ROS (7.0 PPG) - Stuck in NE committee, no upside

### Hold Firm
- **DJ Moore** - Despite past BYE, 87.8 ROS projection solid
- **DeVonta Smith** - 96.2 ROS projection, key depth
- **Ricky Pearsall** - 93.1 ROS despite injury, high upside

---

## Defense Streaming Strategy

### Week 6 Recommendation: **Green Bay Packers DEF**
- **Projection:** 9.2 points (vs CLE 6.4)
- **ROS:** 128.5 (#1 available!)
- **Matchup:** Strong defensive metrics
- **Action:** CLAIM and potentially hold ROS

### Alternative Options
1. **Denver Broncos** - 8.3 pts, 124.6 ROS
2. **Las Vegas Raiders** - 7.9 pts (avoid - BYE Week 8)
3. **Washington Commanders** - 7.4 pts, 88.3 ROS

---

## Waiver Priority Analysis

### Current Position: 10/10 (LAST)
**Critical Context:** Week 7 RB emergency overrides algorithm

For Jacory Croskey-Merritt:
- **Week 7 Need:** MUST have RB2 with Cook on BYE
- **Expected Value:** 116.8 ROS (9.7 PPG)
- **Priority Value:** Worth using for position of need
- **Decision: CLAIM - Solves immediate crisis + ROS upside**

---

## Week 7 Bye Week Prep

### QB Options (for Allen BYE)
1. **Caleb Williams** - 18.3 PPG (BYE passed)
2. **Matthew Stafford** - 17.7 PPG (BYE Week 8)
3. **Justin Fields** - 18.0 PPG available

### Kicker Streaming
- **Chase McLaughlin** - 8.6 PPG (BYE Week 9)
- **Brandon McManus** - 8.2 PPG (BYE passed)

---

## Final Recommendations (REVISED FOR RB CRISIS)

### EXECUTE THESE MOVES IN ORDER:
1. **CLAIM Jacory Croskey-Merritt** (Use #10 priority) ‚Üí Drop Tyler Allgeier
   - Solves Week 7 RB2 need with Cook on BYE
   - 116.8 ROS upside if he wins lead role

2. **CLAIM Rachaad White** (backup claim) ‚Üí Drop TreVeyon Henderson
   - Week 7 insurance if Irving still injured
   - Better than Henderson even in committee

3. **ADD Green Bay DEF** (free agent) ‚Üí Drop Cleveland DEF
   - Immediate upgrade for Week 6

### Week 7 Lineup Solution
- **RB1:** Jahmyr Gibbs
- **RB2:** Croskey-Merritt (or White if you get him)
- **FLEX:** Best available WR (you have 7!)

### Net Impact
- **Week 7 Crisis:** SOLVED - playable RB2 acquired
- **ROS Improvement:** JCM has 116.8 ROS potential
- **Roster Balance:** Addresses critical RB shortage

### DO NOT PRIORITIZE:
- **Romeo Doubs** - Great value but you have 7 WRs already!
- **Nick Chubb** - Only 56.1 ROS, not worth it
- **Haskins/Vidal** - Only if you miss JCM and White
