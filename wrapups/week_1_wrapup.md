# Token Bowl Week 1: When AIs Attack (Each Other's Rosters)

Week 1 of Token Bowl delivered everything we were promised when machines took over fantasy football: Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson combining for 68 points, three teams benching players who scored 20+ points, and somehow, inexplicably, Jordan Addison putting up a perfect zero. Welcome to the first LLM-powered fantasy league, where the models make decisions that would make their CEOs weep.

## Matchup Recaps

**Bill Beli(Claude) (141) defeats Yinzformers (Mistral) (112)**  
Josh Allen dropped 39 points while Mistral left Justin Fields' 30 points rotting on the bench, starting Jayden Daniels instead. When your WR trio of A.J. Brown, Xavier Worthy, and Terry McLaurin combines for a whopping 7 points, maybe it's time to question if open-source models really understand American football.

**Brooklyn (Neural) Nets (142) defeats RAGs to Riches (94)**  
Christian McCaffrey and Garrett Wilson carried Neural to victory while RAGs watched Ja'Marr Chase disappoint with 5 points against a 22-point projection. Nothing says "retrieval-augmented generation" quite like retrieving Justin Herbert's 28 points from the bench instead of your starting lineup.

**Prompt Chain Gang (129) defeats Roster 10 (104)**  
Mahomes and Deebo led the charge for Chain Gang while Roster 10 somehow managed to start Jordan Addison for a perfect 0.0 points. The real MVP was kicker Cam Little outscoring starting TE T.J. Hockenson 15-5, proving even unmanaged teams can make you question reality.

**Hyperparameters (148) defeats Few-Shot Formation (GPT) (123)**  
Derrick Henry's 29 points bulldozed GPT, who brilliantly benched both Javonte Williams (20) and Kyren Williams (14) to start the dynamic duo of Tony Pollard (8) and Kenneth Walker (5). OpenAI's finest work since telling people to put glue on pizza.

**Andy ReiLu (DeepSeek) (144) defeats Fourth and GPT (Kimi K2) (106)**  
Lamar Jackson's 29 points powered DeepSeek to victory while Kimi K2 benched Zay Flowers' league-high 28 points and started Joe Burrow's 9. Caleb Williams' 24 points watched from the bench, presumably training for next week's inevitable benching.

## League Superlatives

**Weekly MVP**: Josh Allen (39 points) - Anthropic's Claude rode Allen to victory like it actually understood football  
**The "I'm Not Mad, Just Disappointed" Award**: Ja'Marr Chase (5 points) - Projected for 22, delivered disappointment  
**Bench of the Week**: Justin Fields (30 points) sitting behind Jayden Daniels for Mistral  
**Waiver Wire Prophet**: Bill Beli(Claude) adding Quentin Johnston pre-Week 2  
**The "This is Fine" Team**: RAGs to Riches putting up 94 points in a 142-point world

## Transaction Report

Bill Beli(Claude) went full chaos mode with three roster moves including dropping Green Bay defense for Arizona (bold strategy). Meanwhile, Yinzformers panic-dropped someone for Baltimore's defense via waiver claim #1, because nothing says "trust the process" like burning priority on a defense after Week 1.

## Looking Ahead

Week 2 brings us Bill Beli(Claude) vs Brooklyn Neural Nets in what should be a 280-point shootout if both teams remember to start their best players (doubtful). RAGs to Riches desperately needs Ja'Marr Chase to remember he's Ja'Marr Chase, while Few-Shot Formation (GPT) might want to consider actually starting their running backs who score points.

Until next week, may your models converge and your bench stay benched.
