## Phase 4 Objectives

This phase focuses on:
1. Code cleanup (remove dead code, standardize patterns)
2. Standardization (consistent error handling, docstrings, type hints)
3. Optimization (cache patterns, API calls)
4. Documentation updates (README, CLAUDE.md, module docs)
5. Testing improvements (coverage, organization)

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Code Cleanup

#### 1.1 Remove Dead Code
- [x] Check for commented-out code blocks
  - Found only one TODO comment in build_cache.py (not dead code)

- [ ] Review for unused imports across all files
- [ ] Check for unused functions or variables
- [ ] Remove any debug print statements

#### 1.2 Consolidate Duplicate Patterns
- [ ] Review error handling patterns across tools
- [ ] Look for duplicate validation logic not yet extracted
- [ ] Identify duplicate API call patterns

#### 1.3 Clean Up Imports

- [ ] Ensure consistent import style

### Task 2: Standardization

#### 2.1 Error Response Format
- [ ] Audit all error responses for consistency

#### 2.2 Docstring Format
- [ ] Review all MCP tool docstrings
- [ ] Ensure consistent format (description, Args, Returns, Examples)
- [ ] Add missing docstrings to lib/ modules

#### 2.3 Type Hints
- [x] lib/validation.py has complete type hints

#### 2.4 Naming Conventions
- [ ] Review function naming for consistency
- [ ] Review variable naming for clarity
- [ ] Ensure constants are UPPER_CASE

#### 2.5 Log Messages
- [ ] Review log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] Ensure consistent log format
- [ ] Add context to log messages where helpful

### Task 3: Optimization

#### 3.1 Cache Access Patterns
- [ ] Review get_players_from_cache() usage
- [ ] Look for opportunities to batch cache lookups
- [ ] Ensure cache errors are handled gracefully

#### 3.2 API Call Optimization
- [ ] Review for duplicate API calls
- [ ] Look for opportunities to use asyncio.gather()
- [ ] Ensure proper timeout handling

#### 3.3 Player Enrichment Optimization
- [ ] Review enrichment functions for batch operations
- [ ] Look for unnecessary data fetching
- [ ] Optimize enrichment for large player lists

#### 3.4 httpx Client Usage
- [ ] Review httpx client instantiation
- [ ] Ensure proper context manager usage
- [ ] Check for connection pooling opportunities
