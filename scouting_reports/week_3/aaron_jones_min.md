# Aaron Jones - RB, MIN
**Status**: IR (Hamstring) | **Age**: 30 | **Fantasy Rank**: Waiver Wire

## Season Performance
- Week 1: 15.7 pts (8 car, 23 yds, 3 rec, 44 yds, 1 TD)
- Week 2: 2.3 pts (5 car, 23 yds, 0 rec, 1 tgt) - injured early
- Season Avg: 9.0 PPR pts/game (limited sample)
- Consistency: LOW - injury ended promising start

## Recent Form

- Pass-catching bright spot: 3 catches on 4 targets, TD in Week 1

## Data

**Projections**: 0.7 pts Fantasy Nerds (0.0-12.0 range) - IR status
**Return Timeline**: Earliest Week 8 (Oct 23) vs LAC due to Week 6 bye
**Matchup**: LAC middle-tier run defense upon return

## News & Context
- IR designation = minimum 4-week absence (Weeks 3-6)
- Jordan Mason thriving as bellcow replacement RB
- Vikings signed Cam Akers to practice squad for depth
- Vikings committed to committee approach pre-injury
- Age 30 + recurring soft tissue injuries = major red flag

## Fantasy Verdict
**Action**: DO NOT claim off waivers - HOLD only if IR slot available
**Confidence**: LOW for immediate value, MEDIUM for ROS
- Not worth waiver priority with 4+ week absence minimum
- Mason/Akers offer better immediate value (Weeks 3-7)
- Monitor Week 7 practice reports for potential Week 8 activation
- Trade value cratered - wait for healthy games before selling
- RB2/FLEX ceiling remains but committee role likely upon return
