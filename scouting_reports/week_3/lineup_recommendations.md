# Week 3 Lineup Recommendations - Bill Beliclaude (Roster 2)

## Current Starters Analysis

### Locked-In Starters
- **Josh Allen** (QB) - Already played: 23.02 points ✓
- **James Cook** (RB) - Already played: 20.8 points ✓
- **Jahmyr Gibbs** (RB) - **START** - Elite RB1 in primetime shootout
- **Jake Ferguson** (TE) - **START** - Top-10 TE play with excellent matchup
- **Matt Prater** (K) - Already played: 7.0 points ✓
- **GB Defense** - **START** - DST1 for Week 3

### WR Situation - Critical Decisions

**Current Starting WRs:**
1. **Marvin Harrison Jr** - Risky play vs SF (tough matchup, TD-dependent)
2. **DJ Moore** - WR3/Flex vs DAL (great matchup but losing targets)
3. **DeVonta Smith** - Fringe WR3 @ LAR (limited by Eagles' run game)
4. **Khalil Shakir** - Already played: 14.5 points ✓

**Bench WRs:**
1. **Chris Olave** - SIT (brutal SEA matchup despite volume)
2. **Calvin Ridley** - Risky flex vs IND (struggling with rookie QB)
3. **Quentin Johnston** - High risk/reward @ DEN (Surtain shadow concern)
4. **Troy Franklin** - RISING STAR @ LAC (Week 2 breakout, ascending role)
5. **Keon Coleman** - Already played: 5.0 points

## RECOMMENDED LINEUP CHANGES

### Must-Make Moves:

**SWAP 1: Bench Marvin Harrison Jr → Start Troy Franklin**
- MHJ facing tough 49ers defense, TD-dependent (4.7 pts last week)
- Franklin had 24-point breakout, 83% snaps, chemistry with Nix
- Franklin safer floor + higher ceiling this week

**SWAP 2: Consider Quentin Johnston over DeVonta Smith**
- Smith limited by Eagles' low pass volume (45 attempts in 2 games)
- Johnston has 3 TDs in 2 games despite Surtain risk
- Higher ceiling play if chasing points

## Final Recommended Lineup:

**Starters:**
- QB: Josh Allen ✓
- RB: James Cook ✓
- RB: Jahmyr Gibbs
- WR: DJ Moore (matchup too good to bench)
- WR: Troy Franklin (breakout ascending)
- WR: Khalil Shakir ✓
- TE: Jake Ferguson
- FLEX: Quentin Johnston (TD upside over Smith)
- K: Matt Prater ✓
- DEF: Green Bay

**Key Bench:**
- Marvin Harrison Jr (tough matchup)
- DeVonta Smith (limited ceiling)
- Chris Olave (avoid SEA defense)
- Calvin Ridley (wait for improvement)

## Week 3 Projection:
With Buffalo players contributing 65.3 points already, projected team total: **115-125 points**

## Priority Waiver Considerations:
- Monitor Troy Franklin ownership (38.7% ESPN) - potential league winner
- Watch for QB streaming options if any become available
- Consider handcuffing Gibbs if David Montgomery owner drops
