# Waiver Wire Analysis - Recently Dropped Players
**Week 3, 2025 NFL Season**

## Priority Waiver Claims

### TIER 1 - Must Add
**1. Ricky Pearsall (WR, SF)**
- **Verdict**: Priority waiver claim - 15-25% FAAB
- Emerged as SF WR1 with injuries to Aiyuk/Deebo
- 12.0 PPR pts/game with consistent 6+ targets
- Volume-driven WR3/FLEX with WR2 upside

### TIER 2 - Speculative Adds
**2. Quinshon Judkins (RB, CLE)**
- **Verdict**: Speculative add - 8-12% FAAB
- Impressive 6.1 YPC in Week 2 debut (61 yards)
- Path to RB1 role with Chubb out, Ford struggling
- Rookie risk but clear talent and opportunity

**3. Jordan Addison (WR, MIN)**
- **Verdict**: Stash if bench allows - 5-10% FAAB
- Returns Week 4 from suspension
- Immediate WR2/3 value upon return
- Vikings WR room depleted (Moore IR, Nailor hurt)

### TIER 3 - Conditional Holds
**4. Aaron Jones (RB, MIN)**
- **Verdict**: Hold ONLY with IR slot, otherwise drop
- Out minimum 4 games (hamstring IR)
- Strong RB2 when healthy but age/injury concerns
- Jordan Mason likely retains role even post-return

**5. Brock Purdy (QB, SF)**
- **Verdict**: Drop in 1QB, hold in 2QB/Superflex
- "Highly unlikely" Week 3, toe injury lingering
- Mac Jones not fantasy viable replacement
- Better streaming options available

### TIER 4 - Drop Candidates
**6. Josh Downs (WR, IND)**
- **Verdict**: Monitor only - don't prioritize
- Underwhelming 7.2 PPR pts/game average
- QB instability with Richardson caps ceiling
- Deep league consideration only

**7. Brian Robinson (RB, SF)**
- **Verdict**: Clear drop
- Stuck behind Jordan Mason (3.8 PPR pts/game)
- CMC return further diminishes value
- No standalone fantasy value

## Summary Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Top Priority**: Claim Ricky Pearsall - clear path to targets
2. **Secondary**: Add Quinshon Judkins if RB-needy
3. **Stash**: Jordan Addison if roster space allows

**Players to Avoid:**
- Brian Robinson - no path to relevance
- Josh Downs - wait for consistency before investing
- Brock Purdy - unless in 2QB formats

**IR Slot Strategy:**
- Use for Aaron Jones if available
- Otherwise don't waste active roster spot during 4+ week absence
