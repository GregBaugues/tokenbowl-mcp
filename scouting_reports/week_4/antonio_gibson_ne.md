- **Age**: 27

## Season Performance
- Week 1: 0.3 pts (1 carry/3 yds, 1 target)

- Week 3: 0.8 pts (7 carries/28 yds, 1 fumble lost)

- 0 touchdowns, 1 fumble lost
- Snap share declining: Week 3 only 25.7%

**Week 4 Projection**:
- FFNerds: 5.6 pts (Range: 1.0-6.1)
- Confidence: LOW - wide variance reflects uncertain role

**Matchup**: vs Carolina
- Favorable run defense matchup
- But unlikely to benefit given depth chart position

## News & Context
- Lost fumble Week 3 after Stevenson's 2 fumbles; coaches frustrated with RB ball security
- Rookie Henderson emerged Week 3: led backfield 46% snap share, 11 carries
- Primary value now as kick returner, not RB production
- Patriots RB coach signaling Henderson earning more trust after veterans' fumbles

## Fantasy Verdict
- **Recommendation**: AVOID - Do not add
- **Confidence**: HIGH
- Gibson offers no floor (averaging 4.3 carries/gm) and minimal ceiling as RB3. Fumble issues jeopardize already limited role. Rookie Henderson trending up while Gibson trends down. Only 5.6 pt projection with high downside risk. Not worth roster spot even in deep leagues for RB depth.
