- **Matchup**: Week 4 vs Houston Texans defense

## News & Context
- **Play-Caller Change**: Titans handed play-calling duties to QBs coach Bo Hardegree after 0-3 start
- **Offensive Struggles**: Titans rank 28th in points, 31st in total yards, dead last in yards per play
- **Hardegree Track Record**: Improved Raiders offense from 15.8 to 22.9 PPG in 2023 stint
- **Schedule Relief**: Titans faced brutal defensive gauntlet (Broncos, Rams, Colts) - easier schedule ahead
- **Depth Chart**: Remains clear WR1 with minimal competition from Elic Ayomanor

## Fantasy Verdict
- **Hold/Borderline**: Ridley maintains target volume but efficiency concerns mount
- **Not Droppable**: Still seeing 7+ targets in worst-case offensive scenario
- **Upside Potential**: Play-caller change could unlock better offensive rhythm
- **Confidence**: Medium - Volume floor exists but ceiling capped by offensive ineptitude

**Bottom Line**: Ridley's 7 targets per game provide a safety net, but the Titans offense is historically bad. The Bo Hardegree change offers hope - his Raiders stint showed significant improvement. Hold unless you need immediate production elsewhere. Better days likely ahead with easier schedule and new play-caller.
