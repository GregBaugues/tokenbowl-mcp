- **Week 2 @ DEN**: Best game with 6/51/0 on 8 targets showing chemistry with Daniel Jones
- **Week 1 vs MIA**: Disappointing 2/12/0 on just 3 targets as Colts spread ball around

## Data

- Led Colts WRs in efficiency metrics, outperforming Pittman

**Week 4 Projection (Fantasy Nerds)**:
- Projected: 9.5 fantasy points
- Range: 8.1 (floor) to 12.95 (ceiling)
- Medium confidence based on volatile usage

**Matchup**: Week 4 vs Jacksonville

## News & Context
- **QB Situation**: Daniel Jones solidified as starter (QB3 Week 1, QB5 Week 2) - typically supports slot receivers
- **Target Competition**: Tyler Warren (rookie TE) emerged as target hog Week 1 (9 targets), stealing slot work
- **Ankle Injury**: Missed Wednesday practice Week 3, returned Thursday, played through but limited snaps
- **Usage Concerns**: Only 4.7 targets/game far below his 2024 average; offense spreading touches widely
- **Recent Drop**: Dropped by Roster 6 on 9/17 for Jauan Jennings (who's now injured)

## Fantasy Verdict
**Hold/Add with Caution** - Low confidence

Downs profiles as a buy-low candidate given his elite 2024 metrics, but 2025 usage is concerning. The emergence of Tyler Warren and offensive philosophy favoring outside receivers caps his ceiling. Worth rostering in 12+ team leagues as WR4/5 with upside if target share normalizes to 20%+. His 71% catch rate and route-running skills provide PPR floor, but touchdown dependency and volatile target share make him a risky weekly start until usage improves.

**Waiver Priority**: Mid-tier add if available - superior talent to most waiver options but frustrating deployment
