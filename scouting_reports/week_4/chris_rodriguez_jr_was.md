# Chris Rodriguez Jr. - RB, Washington Commanders

## Player Overview
- **Position**: RB
- **Team**: Washington Commanders
- **Fantasy Ranking**: RB46 (Week 4)
- **Depth Chart**: RB2/Committee back

## Season Performance
- **Week 1**: Inactive (healthy scratch)
- **Week 2**: Inactive (healthy scratch)
- **Week 3**: 3.9 fantasy points (11 carries, 39 yards, 0 TDs)
- **Season Average**: 3.9 PPG (1 game played)
- **Consistency**: N/A - Limited sample

## Recent Form (Last 3 Weeks)
- Weeks 1-2: Completely inactive due to healthy scratches
- Week 3 vs LV: Led team in carries (11) but struggled with efficiency (3.5 YPC)
- Emerged as committee back after Ekeler injury, competing with Croskey-Merritt and McNichols

## Current Role & Depth Chart Position
**Commanders RB Depth Chart**:
1. Jacory "Bill" Croskey-Merritt (rookie 7th round) - Lead back
2. Chris Rodriguez Jr. - Power/goal-line specialist
3. Jeremy McNichols - Veteran depth/pass-catching

**Rodriguez's Role**:
- Power back at 6'2", 224 lbs for short-yardage situations
- Goal-line candidate due to size advantage
- Early-down specialist when committee approach is used

## Competition Analysis
**vs Croskey-Merritt**: Rookie has seized RB1 role but lacks receiving upside (7 catches in college). Rodriguez provides different skill set as power back.

**vs McNichols**: Veteran brings pass-catching ability (60-yard TD Week 3) but Rodriguez has size advantage for goal-line work.

**Opportunity Created**: Brian Robinson trade (187 carries, 8 TDs in 2024) and Ekeler injury (season-ending Achilles) opened significant touches.

## Data
**Historical Points**:
- Week 3: 3.9 PPR points

**Key Stats (Week 3)**:
- Carries: 11 (team-high)
- Rushing Yards: 39 (3.5 YPC)
- Targets/Receptions: 0
- Touchdowns: 0

**Week 4 Projection** (vs IND):
- Fantasy Nerds: 7.6 points
- Range: 4.3-9.33 points
- Confidence: LOW

## Rest of Season Outlook
**Positive Factors**:
- Commanders offense ranks 5th in implied scoring (27 PPG)
- Goal-line role potential with ideal size
- Limited competition for power back duties
- Opportunity from 195+ vacated touches (Robinson/Ekeler)

**Concerns**:
- Committee approach limits weekly ceiling
- No receiving ability shown (0 targets through 1 game)
- Poor efficiency (3.5 YPC) in debut
- Croskey-Merritt established as lead back

## Fantasy Value Assessment (PPR)
**Current Value**: Handcuff/depth piece only
**Ceiling**: Flex option if goal-line role emerges
**Floor**: Waiver wire fodder in committees

**12-Team League**: Speculative add in deeper leagues
**10-Team League**: Monitor only unless desperate for RB depth
**Redraft**: Low priority behind proven commodities
**Dynasty**: Hold as young asset with opportunity

## Handcuff/Depth Analysis
**Worth Rostering?**
- **YES in 12+ team leagues**: Significant opportunity vacuum in WAS backfield
- **NO in 10-team leagues**: Better options likely available
- **Croskey-Merritt handcuff value**: MODERATE - Rodriguez would likely lead committee if rookie injured

**Key Factors**:
- Must establish goal-line role to gain consistent value
- Needs 15+ weekly touches or red zone work for viability
- Committee situation makes him boom/bust weekly play

## News & Context
- Austin Ekeler suffered season-ending torn Achilles in Week 2
- Brian Robinson traded to 49ers, vacating team-leading role
- Coach Dan Quinn hinted at expanded role for Rodriguez
- Team using 3-way committee approach currently
- Rodriguez profile fits power/short-yardage specialist role

## Fantasy Verdict
- **Trade Value**: Minimal - sell-high candidate if gets goal-line TDs
- **Waiver Priority**: Low-medium in 12+ team leagues only
- **Start/Sit Week 4**: SIT - Desperation flex in deepest formats
- **Rest of Season**: Monitor for goal-line role development
- **Confidence**: LOW

**Bottom Line**: Rodriguez represents lottery ticket upside given opportunity in Washington, but committee approach and poor efficiency make him unstartable outside desperation. Worth rostering as speculative depth piece to see if role expands, particularly goal-line work.
