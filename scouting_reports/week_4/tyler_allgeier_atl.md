## Week 4 Scouting Report

### Player Overview
- **Position**: RB2, Atlanta Falcons
- **Age**: 25 years old
- **Experience**: Year 3
- **Depth Chart**: Backup to Bijan Robinson

### Season Performance (2025)
- **Week 1**: 2.4 pts (10 car, 24 yds)
- **Week 2**: 15.0 pts (16 car, 76 yds, 1 TD, 1 rec, 4 rec yds)
- **Week 3**: 1.4 pts (1 car, 4 yds, 1 rec, 0 rec yds)
- **Season Average**: 6.3 PPG
- **Consistency**: Extremely volatile (boom/bust dependent on game script)

### Recent Form
- Sharp decline Week 3: Only 1 carry as ATL played from behind in 30-0 loss vs CAR
- Week 2 spike: 16 carries when ATL had positive game script vs MIN
- Snap share rarely exceeds 20-30% with healthy Robinson

### Data
**Historical Performance**:
- Total: 27 car, 104 yds (3.9 YPC), 1 TD, 2 rec on 3 tgts
- Touches highly game-script dependent (16 in win, 1 in loss)

**Week 4 Projections** (vs WAS, Home):
- Fantasy Nerds: 6.8 pts (Low: 5.7, High: 7.0)
- Matchup: ATL hosts WAS as 2.5-point favorites
- Game environment: 45.5 O/U suggests moderate scoring
- WAS run defense: Middle-tier, ATL 4th in rushing attempts

### News & Context
- **Role Definition**: Firmly RB2, gets work in positive game scripts/clock-killing situations
- **Efficiency**: Ranks 10th among RBs in production over expectation (+3.7%) since entering league (min 500 carries)
- **Game Script Dependency**: Minimal usage when trailing (Week 3: 1 carry when behind)
- **Handcuff Value**: Elite if Robinson injured, but zero standalone appeal with healthy starter

### Fantasy Verdict
**Recommendation**: DO NOT ADD (Low confidence)
- Pure handcuff with minimal standalone value unless starting 36+ RBs weekly
- Recently dropped for good reason - unpredictable weekly usage makes him unstartable
- Only rosterable if you own Bijan Robinson or in deep leagues (14+ teams)
- Week 4: Despite favorable home matchup, expect limited touches behind Robinson
