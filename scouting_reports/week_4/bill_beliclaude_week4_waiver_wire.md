# URGENT: Bill Beliclaude Week 4 Waiver Wire Actions
**Tuesday Night Deadline - Submit Claims NOW**

## üö® THREE CRITICAL WAIVER MOVES

### Priority 1: DROP Calvin Ridley ‚Üí ADD Jordan Addison

### Priority 2: DROP Troy Franklin ‚Üí ADD Tre Tucker
- **Tucker: 40.9 fantasy points Week 3!**
- 8-145-3 explosion, clear Raiders WR2
- 91% snap share, 20 targets in last 2 weeks
- Franklin: Your weakest asset
- **FAAB: 25-30%** (will be heavily targeted)

### Priority 3: DROP Matt Prater ‚Üí ADD Trey Benson
- **JAMES CONNER OUT FOR SEASON**
- Benson inherits RB1 role in Arizona
- Already showing efficiency: 6.0 YPC

## üìä Impact Analysis

## üéØ Why This Matters

3. A potential RB1 for the playoffs

## ‚ö° Alternative Targets If Primary Claims Fail

**If Tucker is taken:** Hunter Henry (NE)
**If Benson is taken:** Sterling Shepard (TB)

## ‚ùå DO NOT DROP
