**Week 4 Projection (Fantasy Nerds)**:
- Points: 7.6 (Low: 4.3, High: 9.33)
- Confidence: Medium-Low

**Matchup**: vs Atlanta Falcons (Top-10 run defense - difficult matchup)

## News & Context
- Austin Ekeler ruled out for season creates expanded opportunity
- Three-back rotation: Croskey-Merritt (lead), Rodriguez (power), McNichols (passing downs)
- 224-pound frame makes him natural goal-line candidate in Washington offense
- Expert consensus: 18-20% FAAB recommendation for waiver claims
- Upcoming schedule challenging: ATL and LAC both have elite run defenses
- "One injury away" from significant fantasy relevance as primary handcuff

## Fantasy Verdict
**Waiver Priority**: Medium-Low (speculative add in 12+ team leagues)
**Confidence**: Low (unclear role hierarchy, tough schedule)

Rodriguez represents classic handcuff value with goal-line upside. Physical profile and Washington's need for power runner create opportunity, but three-way committee and difficult upcoming matchups limit immediate fantasy impact. Worth adding as depth/stash in deeper leagues but not reliable weekly starter until backfield clarifies. Best-case scenario involves injury to Croskey-Merritt or goal-line touchdown vulturing.
