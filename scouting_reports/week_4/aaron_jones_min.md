## Data

**Fantasy Projections**: 0.7 points (0.0 low, 12.0 high) - reflects IR status
**Historical Performance**:
- 2024: RB12 finish with Green Bay (1,207 rushing + 355 receiving yards)
- Career: Proven RB1 upside when healthy, age-related decline concerns

**Backfield Context**:
- Jordan Mason has taken over as MIN RB1 (out-touched Jones 27-16 in first 2 weeks)
- Cam Akers signed to practice squad as depth insurance
- Ty Chandler also on IR, leaving thin depth chart

## News & Context

- Placed on IR September 17th with hamstring strain - minimum 4-week absence
- Expected return Week 8 vs LAC (October 23rd) at earliest
- Pre-injury reports suggested 50-50 split with Mason, but Mason earned more touches
- Vikings signed veteran Cam Akers for backfield depth during Jones' absence
- At 30 years old, hamstring injuries can linger and affect explosiveness
- Mason averaging 4.1 YPC vs Jones' 3.5 YPC before injury

## Fantasy Verdict

**Recommendation**: SPECULATIVE STASH ONLY - Low confidence
- **IR Stash Value**: Worth adding if you have IR spot and RB depth needs
- **Return Concerns**: Hamstring injuries notoriously difficult for RBs, especially at age 30
- **Backfield Competition**: Mason has proven more effective, may retain lead role upon Jones' return
- **Timeline Risk**: Week 8 return optimistic - could extend longer with setbacks

**Bottom Line**: Available veteran with proven track record, but significant red flags with injury, age, and lost workload to Mason. Only add if desperate for RB depth and have IR flexibility.
