## News & Context
- Suspension lifted, cleared for Week 4 return and full practice participation
- QB situation uncertain: J.J. McCarthy dealing with high-ankle sprain, Carson Wentz started Week 3
- Minnesota added Adam Thielen via trade to cover suspension absence
- Addison's return reduces target share for Thielen and Jalen Nailor
- First game action in 2025, potential rust factor after missing 3 weeks

## Fantasy Verdict
**WR3/FLEX with upside** - Confidence: MEDIUM

Worth waiver claim if available (currently on waivers in Token Bowl). Immediate WR2 role alongside Jefferson provides solid floor once acclimated. Week 4 projection of 12.1 points suggests startable value. QB uncertainty caps ceiling but talent and role secure 8-10 targets weekly. Stash now, start as FLEX Week 4, potential WR2 value Week 5+. Priority add for teams needing WR depth.
