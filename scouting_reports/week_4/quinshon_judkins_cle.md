## News & Context
- Contract holdout resolved just before Week 1 after domestic violence investigation cleared

## Fantasy Verdict
**Strong PICKUP - High Confidence**

Judkins represents rare midseason RB2 value with clear path to 15+ touches weekly. Despite missing camp/preseason, he's seized control of Cleveland's backfield. The Browns' poor offense caps ceiling but guarantees volume through positive game script. Immediate starter in 12+ team leagues, valuable RB depth in all formats. His 5.5 YPC efficiency and red zone role provide weekly floor of 10+ points with TD upside. Must-add if available.

**Trade Value:** Buy-low candidate before breakout recognized
**FAAB:** 25-40% of budget justified
**Start/Sit Week 4:** FLEX with RB2 upside
