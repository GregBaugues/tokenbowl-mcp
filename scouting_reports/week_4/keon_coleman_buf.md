## News & Context
- Listed as WR1 on depth chart but Khalil Shakir dominates slot targets
- Josh Allen praised Coleman in training camp but hasn't translated to consistent usage
- Shakir dealing with ankle issues creates opportunity but hasn't materialized yet
- Joshua Palmer addition provides competition for outside snaps
- Red zone role remains promising (4 TDs as rookie on limited targets)

## Fantasy Verdict
- **Hold/Bench** with Low confidence
- Coleman showing classic sophomore volatility after promising Week 1
- Target floor dangerously low despite WR1 depth chart designation
- Better days likely ahead but unreliable for Week 4 starts

## Drop Analysis: Coleman vs. Pearsall
**Winner: Ricky Pearsall** - Correct move dropping Coleman
- Pearsall: 43.7 points through 3 weeks (14.6 PPG)
- Coleman: 35.8 points through 3 weeks (11.9 PPG)
- Pearsall seeing consistent 6-11 targets with Aiyuk injured
- Coleman's 3-4 target floor makes him unplayable most weeks
- 49ers offensive environment more fantasy-friendly than Buffalo's spread-the-wealth approach
